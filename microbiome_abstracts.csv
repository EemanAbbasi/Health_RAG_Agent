"BACKGROUND	Abdominal obesity and exaggerated postprandial lipemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and mortality , and both are affected by dietary behavior . OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether dietary supplementation with whey protein and medium-chain saturated fatty acids ( MC-SFAs ) improved postprandial lipid metabolism in humans with abdominal obesity . METHODS	We conducted a 12-wk , randomized , double-blinded , diet intervention study . METHODS	Sixty-three adults were randomly allocated to one of 4 diets in a 2 2 factorial design . METHODS	Participants consumed 60 g milk protein ( whey or casein ) and 63 g milk fat ( with high or low MC-SFA content ) daily . METHODS	Before and after the intervention , a high-fat meal test was performed . METHODS	We measured changes from baseline in fasting and postprandial triacylglycerol , apolipoprotein B-48 ( apoB-48 ; reflecting chylomicrons of intestinal origin ) , free fatty acids ( FFAs ) , insulin , glucose , glucagon , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , and gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( GIP ) . METHODS	Furthermore , changes in the expression of adipose tissue genes involved in lipid metabolism were investigated . METHODS	Two-factor ANOVA was used to examine the difference between protein types and fatty acid compositions , as well as any interaction between the two . RESULTS	Fifty-two participants completed the study . RESULTS	We found that the postprandial apoB-48 response decreased significantly after whey compared with casein ( P = 0.025 ) independently of fatty acid composition . RESULTS	Furthermore , supplementation with casein resulted in a significant increase in the postprandial GLP-1 response compared with whey ( P = 0.003 ) . RESULTS	We found no difference in postprandial triacylglycerol , FFA , insulin , glucose , glucagon , or GIP related to protein type or MC-SFA content . RESULTS	We observed no interaction between milk protein and milk fat on postprandial lipemia . CONCLUSIONS	We found that a whey protein supplement decreased the postprandial chylomicron response compared with casein in persons with abdominal obesity , thereby indicating a beneficial impact on CVD risk . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01472666 ."
"METHODS	Genistein from foods or supplements is metabolized by the gut microbiota and the human body , thereby releasing many different metabolites into systemic circulation . METHODS	The order of their appearance in plasma and the possible influence of food format are still unknown . METHODS	This study compared the nutrikinetic profiles of genistein metabolites . RESULTS	In a randomized cross-over trial , 12 healthy young volunteers were administered a single dose of 30 mg genistein provided as a genistein tablet , a genistein tablet in low fat milk , and soy milk containing genistein glycosides . RESULTS	A high mass resolution LC-LTQ-Orbitrap FTMS platform detected and quantified in human plasma : free genistein , seven of its phase-II metabolites and 15 gut-derived metabolites . RESULTS	Interestingly , a novel metabolite , genistein-4 ' - glucuronide-7-sulfate ( G-4 ` G-7S ) was identified . RESULTS	Nutrikinetic analysis using population-based modeling revealed the order of appearance of five genistein phase II metabolites in plasma : ( 1 ) genistein-4 ' ,7 - diglucuronide , ( 2 ) genistein-7-sulfate , ( 3 ) genistein-4 ' - sulfate-7-glucuronide , ( 4 ) genistein-4 ' - glucuronide , and ( 5 ) genistein-7-glucuronide , independent of the food matrix . CONCLUSIONS	The conjugated genistein metabolites appear in a distinct order in human plasma . CONCLUSIONS	The specific early appearance of G-4 ' ,7 - diG suggests a multistep formation process for the mono and hetero genistein conjugates , involving one or two deglucuronidation steps ."
"BACKGROUND	Metformin monotherapy is recommended as initial treatment of type 2 diabetes . BACKGROUND	The selection of optimal second-line therapy that is often necessary due to the progressive nature of the disease is still a subject of ongoing discussions . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the international EDGE ( Effectiveness of Diabetes control with vildaGliptin and vildagliptin/mEtformin ) study was to prospectively compare the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin vs other oral antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on monotherapy in a real-life clinical setting . OBJECTIVE	In this paper , we present the data of patients participating in the EDGE study in the Czech Republic . METHODS	Patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on monotherapy were enrolled into the study , and randomised into either the vildagliptin arm or control arm with another OAD at the discretion of the treating physician . METHODS	Patients with the addition of other incretin-based medications were not enrolled into the study . METHODS	The efficiency was evaluated as a proportion of patients reaching the combined endpoint of decreasing HbA1c > 3 mmol/mol without hypoglycaemia , peripheral oedema or treatment termination due to gastrointestinal side effects during the 12 months of treatment . RESULTS	654 patients were enrolled into the study in the Czech Republic . RESULTS	The mean age of the patients when enrolled into the study ( vildagliptin group vs control group ) was 59.5 10.6 vs 63.7 8.5 years , mean body mass index was 32.4 5.7 vs 31.7 6.5 kg/m2 , mean HbA1c was 62 12 vs 64 11 mmol/mol . RESULTS	The probability of reaching the combined primary endpoint ( calculated using a binary logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals ) was higher for vildagliptin regardless of baseline HbA1c or type of medication added in the control group . RESULTS	Primary endpoint was reached by 60.6 % of patients in the vildagliptin group vs 51.3 % of patients in the control group , odds ratio 1.46 ( 1.06 , 1.99 ) ; p < 0.019 . RESULTS	The proportion of patients reaching secondary endpoint ( HbA1c < 54 mmol/mol without hypoglycemic event or weight gain 3 % with baseline glycated hemoglobin > 54 mmol/mol was higher for vildagliptin 45.7 % vs 31.4 % in the control arm , odds ratio 1.84 ( 1.26 , 2.68 ) , p < 0.001 . RESULTS	The rate of adverse events was comparable in both groups . CONCLUSIONS	In a real-life clinical set-ting , the percentage of patients reaching the combined endpoint of decreasing HbA1c > 3 mmol/mol , without hypoglycaemia , peripheral oedema or treatment termination due to gastrointestinal side effects was higher after the addition of vildagliptin as compared to other antidiabetic agents with comparable rate of side effects ."
"OBJECTIVE	Mealtime insulin is commonly added to manage hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes when basal insulin is insufficient . OBJECTIVE	However , this complex regimen is associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia . OBJECTIVE	This study compared the efficacy and safety of exenatide twice daily or mealtime insulin lispro in patients inadequately controlled by insulin glargine and metformin despite up-titration . METHODS	In this 30-week , open-label , multicenter , randomized , noninferiority trial with 12 weeks prior insulin optimization , 627 patients with insufficient postoptimization glycated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) were randomized to exenatide ( 10-20 g/day ) or thrice-daily mealtime lispro titrated to premeal glucose of 5.6-6 .0 mmol/L , both added to insulin glargine ( mean 61 units/day at randomization ) and metformin ( mean 2,000 mg/day ) . RESULTS	Randomization HbA1c and fasting glucose ( FG ) were 8.3 % ( 67 mmol/mol ) and 7.1 mmol/L for exenatide and 8.2 % ( 66 mmol/mol ) and 7.1 mmol/L for lispro . RESULTS	At 30 weeks postrandomization , mean HbA1c changes were noninferior for exenatide compared with lispro ( -1.13 and -1.10 % , respectively ) ; treatment differences were -0.04 ( 95 % CI -0.18 , 0.11 ) in per-protocol ( n = 510 ) and -0.03 ( 95 % CI -0.16 , 0.11 ) in intent-to-treat ( n = 627 ) populations . RESULTS	FG was lower with exenatide than lispro ( 6.5 vs. 7.2 mmol/L ; P = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	Weight decreased with exenatide and increased with lispro ( -2.5 vs. +2.1 kg ; P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	More patients reported treatment satisfaction and better quality of life with exenatide than lispro , although a larger proportion of patients with exenatide experienced treatment-emergent adverse events . RESULTS	Exenatide resulted in fewer nonnocturnal hypoglycemic episodes but more gastrointestinal adverse events than lispro . CONCLUSIONS	Adding exenatide to titrated glargine with metformin resulted in similar glycemic control as adding lispro and was well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	These findings support exenatide as a noninsulin addition for patients failing basal insulin ."
"OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to describe pretreatment patient characteristics and baseline quality-of-life scores as they relate to the development of grade 3 or 4 toxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced/recurrent cervical cancer . METHODS	The study sample was drawn from Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 179 and 204 . METHODS	Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were considered in 4 specified categories as follows : peripheral neuropathy , fatigue , hematological , and gastrointestinal ( GI ) . METHODS	The data variables explored included age , stage , pretreatment radiation , performance status ( PS ) at treatment initiation , and baseline Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix ( FACT-Cx ) score . METHODS	A logistic regression model was developed with various adverse events as binary ( 0/1 ) outcomes . RESULTS	Six hundred seventy-three patient-reported questionnaires were used in the analyses . RESULTS	At baseline , pain was the most severe patient-reported symptom . RESULTS	Baseline line-item patient concerns did demonstrate specific correlations with the development of individual toxicities . RESULTS	In 401 patients who were enrolled on Gynecologic Oncology Group 204 ( fatigue not measured on 179 ) , a worse PS predicted the development of grade 3 or 4 fatigue ( odds ratio , 2.78 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.66-4 .68 ) . RESULTS	Exposure to previous radiation , treatment regimen , and a worse FACT-Cx score were associated with the reporting of both grade 3 or 4 leukopenia ( P < 0.05 ) and anemia ( P < 0.0005 ) . RESULTS	Performance status and treatment regimen ( P < 0.05 ) were associated with the development of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia . RESULTS	Age and treatment regimen ( P < 0.05 ) were associated with the development of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia . RESULTS	The FACT-Cx score ( P = 0.0016 ) predicted grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity . CONCLUSIONS	The development of fatigue , hematological , and GI toxicity might be predictable based on factors other than treatment assignment such as age , PS , and patient-reported quality-of-life measurement ."
"BACKGROUND	Discontinuations and/or interruptions in aspirin therapy for secondary cardioprotection due to upper gastrointestinal ( UGI ) complications or symptoms have been shown to increase the risk for subsequent cardiovascular events . BACKGROUND	PA32540 is a coordinated-delivery , combination tablet consisting of enteric-coated aspirin ( EC-ASA ) 325 mg and immediate-release ( IR ) omeprazole 40 mg . METHODS	Two identically-designed , 6-month , randomized , double-blind trials evaluated PA32540 vs. EC-ASA 325 mg in a secondary cardiovascular disease prevention population taking aspirin 325 mg daily for 3 months and at risk for ASA-associated gastric ulcers ( GUs ) . METHODS	The combined study population was 1049 subjects ( 524 randomized to PA32540 , 525 to EC-ASA 325 mg ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the occurrence of endoscopically-determined gastric ulceration over 6 months . METHODS	Safety outcomes included the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) and UGI symptoms . RESULTS	Significantly fewer PA32540-treated subjects ( 3.2 % ) developed endoscopic GUs vs. EC-ASA 325 mg-treated subjects ( 8.6 % ) ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	Overall occurrence of MACE was low ( 2.1 % ) , with no significant differences between treatments in types or incidence of MACE . RESULTS	PA32540-treated subjects had significantly fewer UGI symptoms ( P < .001 ) and significantly fewer discontinuations due to pre-specified UGI adverse events ( 1.5 % vs. 8.2 % , respectively ; P < .001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	PA32540 reduced the incidence of endoscopic GUs compared to EC-ASA 325 mg , but with a similar cardiovascular event profile . CONCLUSIONS	Due to fewer UGI symptoms , continuation on aspirin therapy was greater in the PA32540 treatment arm ."
"BACKGROUND	Diets rich in fermentable residues increase intestinal gas production . BACKGROUND	Our aim was to demonstrate the potential effects of diet on gas-related symptoms . METHODS	The effect of a low-flatulogenic test diet ( restricted to foodstuffs low in fermentable residues ; n = 15 ) was compared to that of a balanced control diet ( Mediterranean type ; n = 15 ) in 30 patients complaining of flatulence and other abdominal symptoms using a randomized parallel design . METHODS	The following outcomes were measured daily : number of anal gas evacuations by an event marker , severity of gas-related symptoms by 0-10 scales , and sensation of digestive comfort by a -5 ( unpleasant ) to +5 ( pleasant ) scale . METHODS	Measurements were taken pretreatment for 3days on their habitual diet and for 7days during the treatment phase . RESULTS	No pretreatment differences were detected between patients allocated to the control or test diets . RESULTS	The test diet significantly reduced the number of gas evacuations ( by 5410 % ; p = 0.002 vs basal diet ) whereas the control diet had a lesser effect ( reduction by 289 % ; p = 0.059 vs basal diet ; p = 0.089 vs test diet ) . RESULTS	Compared to the control diet , the test diet significantly reduced flatulence ( by 487 % vs 278 % , respectively ; p = 0.018 ) , abdominal distension ( by 484 % vs 2212 % , respectively ; p = 0.038 ) , and enhanced digestive well-being ( by 14918 % vs 5822 % , respectively ; p = 0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS	In patients with gas-related symptoms , a low-flatulogenic diet produces immediate beneficial effects with digestive , cognitive , and emotive dimensions . CONCLUSIONS	The number of gas evacuations is an objective biological marker of response to dietary treatment ."
"BACKGROUND	School-based mass treatment with praziquantel is the cornerstone for schistosomiasis control in school-aged children . BACKGROUND	However , uptake of treatment among school-age children in Uganda is low in some areas . BACKGROUND	The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a pre-treatment snack on uptake of mass treatment . RESULTS	In a cluster randomized trial carried out in Jinja district , Uganda , 12 primary schools were randomized into two groups ; one received education messages for schistosomiasis prevention for two months prior to mass treatment , while the other , in addition to the education messages , received a pre-treatment snack shortly before mass treatment . RESULTS	Four weeks after mass treatment , uptake of praziquantel was assessed among a random sample of 595 children in the snack schools and 689 children in the non-snack schools as the primary outcome . RESULTS	The occurrence of side effects and the prevalence and mean intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection were determined as the secondary outcomes . RESULTS	Uptake of praziquantel was higher in the snack schools , 93.9 % ( 95 % CI 91.7 % -95.7 % ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , 78.7 % ( 95 % CI 75.4 % -81.7 % ) ( p = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	The occurrence of side effects was lower in the snack schools , 34.4 % ( 95 % CI 31.5 % -39.8 % ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , 46.9 % ( 95 % CI 42.2 % -50.7 % ) ( p = 0.041 ) . RESULTS	Prevalence and mean intensity of S. mansoni infection was lower in the snack schools , 1.3 % ( 95 % CI 0.6 % -2.6 % ) and 38.3 eggs per gram of stool ( epg ) ( 95 % CI 21.8-67 .2 ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , 14.1 % ( 95 % CI 11.6 % -16.9 % ) ( p = 0.001 ) and 78.4 epg ( 95 % CI 60.6-101 .5 ) ( p = 0.001 ) , respectively . CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that provision of a pre-treatment snack combined with education messages achieves a higher uptake compared to the education messages alone . CONCLUSIONS	The use a pre-treatment snack was associated with reduced side effects as well as decreased prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection .

"BACKGROUND	Gut microbiota modifiers may have beneficial effects of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) but randomised controlled trials ( RCT ) are lacking in children . OBJECTIVE	To perform a double-blind RCT of VSL # 3 vs. placebo in obese children with biopsy-proven NAFLD . METHODS	Of 48 randomised children , 44 ( 22 VSL # 3 and 22 placebo ) completed the study . METHODS	The main outcome was the change in fatty liver severity at 4 months as detected by ultrasonography . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were the changes in triglycerides , insulin resistance as detected by the homoeostasis model assessment ( HOMA ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) and activated GLP-1 ( aGLP-1 ) . METHODS	Ordinal and linear models with cluster confidence intervals were used to evaluate the efficacy of VSL # 3 vs. placebo at 4 months . RESULTS	At baseline , moderate and severe NAFLD were present in 64 % and 36 % of PLA children and in 55 % and 45 % of VSL # 3 children . RESULTS	The probability that children supplemented with VSL # 3 had none , light , moderate or severe FL at the end of the study was 21 % , 70 % , 9 % and 0 % respectively with corresponding values of 0 % , 7 % , 76 % and 17 % for the placebo group ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	No between-group differences were detected in triglycerides , HOMA and ALT while BMI decreased and GLP-1 and aGLP1 increased in the VSL # 3 group ( P < 0.001 for all comparisons ) . CONCLUSIONS	A 4-month supplement of VSL # 3 significantly improves NAFLD in children . CONCLUSIONS	The VSL # 3-dependent GLP-1 increase could be responsible for these beneficial effects . CONCLUSIONS	Trial identifier : NCT01650025 ( www.clinicaltrial.gov ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Curative treatment of upper gastrointestinal tract neoplasms is complex and associated with high morbidity and mortality . BACKGROUND	In general , the patients are already malnourished , and early postoperative enteral nutrition is recommended . BACKGROUND	However , there is no consensus concerning the best enteral access route in these cases . METHODS	A prospective randomized trial was performed from 2008 to 2012 with 59 patients who underwent esophagectomy , total gastrectomy , or pancreaticoduodenectomy . METHODS	In all , 4 patients declined to participate , and 13 did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded . METHODS	Of the 42 included patients , 21 had nasoenteric tubes , and 21 had a jejunostomy . RESULTS	The two groups were similar in demographic and clinical aspects . RESULTS	The nasoenteric ( NE ) and jejunostomy groups underwent early enteral therapy in 71 and 62 % of cases ( p > 0.05 ) , respectively . RESULTS	The median length of enteral therapy use was less in the NE group ( 5.0 vs. 8.5 days ) , but the difference was not statistically significant . RESULTS	The NE group required introduction of parenteral therapy more frequently than the jejunostomy group ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Complications related to the enteral route occurred in 38.0 and 28.5 % of patients ( p > 0.05 ) in the NE and jejunostomy groups , respectively . RESULTS	In the NE group , there were four losses and four tube obstructions . RESULTS	In the jejunostomy group , there were two losses , four obstructions , and two cases of leakage around the tube . RESULTS	In the latter group , patients who underwent therapy for a longer time had tubal complications ( p < 0.05 ) and longer intensive care unit and hospital stays ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The two enteral routes were associated with the same number of complications . CONCLUSIONS	However , the presence of a jejunostomy allowed enteral therapy for longer periods , especially in patients with complications , thus avoiding the need for parenteral nutrition ."
"OBJECTIVE	HM30181 is a third generation P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) inhibitor currently under development . OBJECTIVE	The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a single dose of HM30181 on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of loperamide , a P-gp substrate , and to compare them with those of quinidine . METHODS	Eighteen healthy male subjects were administered loperamide alone ( period 1 ) or with loperamide plus quinidine or HM30181 in period 2 or 3 , respectively . METHODS	In period 3 , subjects randomly received one of three HM30181 doses : 15 , 60 or 180mg . METHODS	Changes in pupil size , alertness , oxygen saturation and the oral bioavailability of loperamide were assessed in each period . METHODS	In addition , the pharmacokinetics of HM30181 were determined . RESULTS	Pupil size , alertness and oxygen saturation did not change over time when loperamide alone or loperamide plus HM30181 was administered while HM30181 significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide , i.e. the geometric mean ratio ( 90 % confidence interval ) of AUC ( 0 , tlast ) for loperamide with and without HM30181 was 1.48 ( 1.08 , 2.02 ) . RESULTS	Co-administered quinidine significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide 2.2-fold ( 1.53 , 3.18 ) , which also markedly reduced pupil size , resulting in a decrease of 24.7 mmh in the area under the effect curve of pupil size change from baseline compared with loperamide alone . CONCLUSIONS	HM30181 inhibits P-gp mainly in the intestinal endothelium , which can be beneficial because pan-inhibition of P-gp , particularly in the brain , could lead to detrimental adverse events . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted to investigate adequately the dose-exposure relationship of HM30181 , along with its duration of effect ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of weekly albiglutide with daily sitagliptin , daily glimepiride , and placebo . METHODS	Patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin were randomized to albiglutide ( 30 mg ) , sitagliptin ( 100 mg ) , glimepiride ( 2 mg ) , or placebo . METHODS	Blinded dose titration for albiglutide ( to 50 mg ) and glimepiride ( to 4 mg ) was based on predefined hyperglycemia criteria . METHODS	The primary end point was change in HbA1c from baseline at week 104 . METHODS	Secondary end points included fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , weight , and time to hyperglycemic rescue . RESULTS	Baseline characteristics were similar among the albiglutide ( n = 302 ) , glimepiride ( n = 307 ) , sitagliptin ( n = 302 ) , and placebo ( n = 101 ) groups . RESULTS	Baseline HbA1c was 8.1 % ( 65.0 mmol/mol ) ; mean age was 54.5 years . RESULTS	The mean doses for albiglutide and glimepiride at week 104 were 40.5 and 3.1 mg , respectively . RESULTS	At week 104 , albiglutide significantly reduced HbA1c compared with placebo ( -0.9 % [ -9.8 mmol/mol ] ; P < 0.0001 ) , sitagliptin ( -0.4 % [ -4.4 mmol/mol ] ; P = 0.0001 ) , and glimepiride ( -0.3 % [ -3.3 mmol/mol ] ; P = 0.0033 ) . RESULTS	Outcomes for FPG and HbA1c were similar . RESULTS	Weight change from baseline for each were as follows : albiglutide -1.21 kg ( 95 % CI -1.68 to -0.74 ) , placebo -1.00 kg ( 95 % CI -1.81 to -0.20 ) , sitagliptin -0.86 kg ( 95 % CI -1.32 to -0.39 ) , glimepiride 1.17 kg ( 95 % CI 0.70-1 .63 ) . RESULTS	The difference between albiglutide and glimepiride was statistically significant ( P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Hyperglycemic rescue rate at week 104 was 25.8 % for albiglutide compared with 59.2 % ( P < 0.0001 ) , 36.4 % ( P = 0.0118 ) , and 32.7 % ( P = 0.1504 ) for placebo , sitagliptin , and glimepiride , respectively . RESULTS	Rates of serious adverse events in the albiglutide group were similar to comparison groups . RESULTS	Diarrhea ( albiglutide 12.9 % , other groups 8.6-10 .9 % ) and nausea ( albiglutide 10.3 % , other groups 6.2-10 .9 % ) were generally the most frequently reported gastrointestinal events . CONCLUSIONS	Added to metformin , albiglutide was well tolerated ; produced superior reductions in HbA1c and FPG at week 104 compared with placebo , sitagliptin , and glimepiride ; and resulted in weight loss compared with glimepiride ."
"BACKGROUND	Neuropeptide S Receptor ( NPSR1 ) gene has been associated with multiple allergic phenotypes in several patient populations . OBJECTIVE	We analysed the effect of the NPSR1 genotypes in the development of asthma , rhinitis , eczema , or food allergy in children randomly receiving either probiotic or placebo treatment . METHODS	796 children born to families at high risk for allergic diseases were examined by a paediatrician at the age of three months , six months , two years , and five years . METHODS	Asthma , rhinitis , eczema , and food allergy were diagnosed according to international guidelines . METHODS	Treatment with probiotics ( double-blinded and placebo controlled ) was begun with mothers at 35 weeks of gestation age and continued after the birth of infants up to the age of six months . METHODS	Association and additive inheritance models were used in genetic analyses . RESULTS	Distribution of the hopo546333 was suggestive in the group of patients with atopic eczema at two years . RESULTS	The hopo546333_G was found more often in those with eczema in the placebo group ( p = 0.048 , after Bonferroni correction ) and the hopo546333_A was found more often in those with eczema and probiotics compared to those with eczema and placebo treatment . RESULTS	None of the NPSR1 tagging SNPs was associated with asthma , IgE-mediated asthma , or sensitisation . RESULTS	Allergic disease in both parents doubled the risk for IgE-mediated allergic disease ( OR 2.1 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The NPSR1 gene SNP hopo546333 showed a suggestive association for high IgE-associated atopic eczema at two years ."

"BACKGROUND	School absenteeism because of infections is one of the most important problems facing both public and private primary schools . BACKGROUND	The aim of the study was to assess the impact of infections on school absenteeism and their reduction with a handwashing program using hand sanitizer . METHODS	The study was an 8-month-long , randomized , controlled open study ( N = 1,609 children , aged 4-12 years old ) at 5 state schools in Almeria ( Spain ) . METHODS	The experimental group ( EG ) washed their hands with soap and water , complemented with the use of hand sanitizer , and the control group ( CG ) followed the usual handwashing procedure . METHODS	The total number of episodes and days missed as well as those because of upper respiratory infections and gastrointestinal infections were compared in both groups with a Z-test . RESULTS	The students were absent 12,386 days in 7,945 episodes . RESULTS	The incidence of total absent episodes and percent of missed days , including those because of upper respiratory infections and gastrointestinal infections , were significantly lower in the EG than the CG ( P < .001 ) , and this was maintained through the flu pandemic period . CONCLUSIONS	School absenteeism because of infections in schools is reduced when a hand hygiene program utilizing sanitizing gels is properly carried out , especially during the flu season ."
"BACKGROUND	Tapentadol prolonged release ( PR ) is effective and well tolerated for chronic osteoarthritis , low back , and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol PR compared with placebo and morphine controlled release ( CR ) for managing moderate to severe chronic malignant tumor-related pain . METHODS	Randomized-withdrawal , parallel group , active - and placebo-controlled , double-blind phase 3 study ( NCT00472303 ) . METHODS	Primary , secondary , and tertiary care settings in 16 countries . METHODS	Eligible patients ( pain intensity 5 [ 11-point numerical rating scale ] on prior analgesics ) were randomized ( 2:1 ) and titrated to their optimal dose of tapentadol PR ( 100-250 mg bid ) or morphine sulfate CR ( 40-100 mg bid ) over 2 weeks . METHODS	Morphine sulfate immediate release 10 mg was permitted as needed for rescue medication ( no maximum dose ) . METHODS	Patients who completed titration and , during the last 3 days of titration , had mean pain intensity < 5 ( based on twice-daily ratings ) and mean rescue medication use = 20 mg/day continued into a 4-week maintenance period ; patients who received morphine CR during titration continued taking morphine CR , and those who received tapentadol PR were re-randomized ( 1:1 ) to tapentadol PR or placebo bid . METHODS	Response during maintenance ( primary efficacy endpoint ) was defined as having : ( 1 ) completed the maintenance period , ( 2 ) a mean pain intensity < 5 during maintenance , and ( 3 ) used an average of = 20 mg/day of rescue medication during maintenance . METHODS	Response at the end of titration was defined similarly , with pain intensity and rescue medication averages based on the last 3 days of titration . RESULTS	Of 622 patients screened , 496 were randomized , treated during titration , and evaluable for safety ; 327 were re-randomized , treated during maintenance , and evaluable for safety ; and 325 were evaluable for efficacy . RESULTS	The adjusted responder rate estimate during maintenance ( logistic regression adjusting for treatment group , pooled center , and pain intensity at start of maintenance ) was significantly higher with tapentadol PR ( 64.3 % ) than with placebo ( 47.1 % ; odds ratio ( OR ) , 2.02 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.12 - 3.65 ] ; P = 0.02 ) . RESULTS	Based on responder rates at the end of titration , tapentadol PR ( 76.0 % [ 174/229 ] ) was non-inferior to morphine CR ( 83.0 % [ 83/100 ] ) . RESULTS	The lower limit of the 95 % CI for the between-groups difference ( -15.5 % ) was within the pre-specified 20 % non-inferiority margin . RESULTS	During titration , incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were 50.0 % ( 169/338 ) with tapentadol PR and 63.9 % ( 101/158 ) with morphine CR ; incidences of nausea , vomiting , and dry mouth were lower with tapentadol PR than with morphine CR . RESULTS	During maintenance , incidences of TEAEs were 56.3 % ( 63/112 ) , 62.3 % ( 66/106 ) , and 62.4 % ( 68/109 ) with placebo , tapentadol PR , and morphine CR , respectively . CONCLUSIONS	Statistical comparisons between tapentadol PR and morphine CR were limited to descriptive statistics during the maintenance period because of the pre-selection of responders to tapentadol PR or morphine CR during titration . CONCLUSIONS	Results obtained during maintenance indicate that tapentadol PR ( 100-250 mg bid ) is effective compared with placebo for managing moderate to severe chronic malignant tumor-related pain . CONCLUSIONS	Based on results obtained during titration , tapentadol PR provides comparable efficacy to that of morphine sulfate CR ( 40-100 mg bid ) , but is associated with better gastrointestinal tolerability ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of oral administration of probiotics on intestinal colonization with drug-resistant bacteria among preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . METHODS	A double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial was carried out in the preterm infants who were transferred to the NICU immediately after birth . METHODS	These infants were stratified by whether they were breastfed and then randomized into test group and control group . METHODS	The test group was given probiotics from the day when enteral feeding began , while the control group was treated conventionally without probiotics . METHODS	The two groups were compared in terms of the colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria , as assessed by rectal swabs on days 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 after birth , and the incidence of diseases . RESULTS	Rectal colonization with drug-resistant bacteria was found in the test group ( n = 119 ) and control group ( n = 138 ) on days 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 after birth . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the incidence of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Among non-breastfed infants , the test group had significantly decreased rectal colonization with drug-resistant bacteria compared with the control group on day 14 after birth ( 71.1 % vs 88.9 % ; P = 0.04 ) . RESULTS	No probiotic-related adverse events were observed in the study . CONCLUSIONS	Oral administration of probiotics may reduce rectal colonization with drug-resistant bacteria in preterm infants under certain conditions and shows good safety ."
"BACKGROUND	The optimal crystalloid solution to use perioperatively in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy remains unclear . BACKGROUND	Many of the fluids used for intravenous hydration contain supraphysiologic concentrations of chloride , which can induce hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis , resulting in renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal function . BACKGROUND	In addition , patients receiving less fluid and less sodium show faster recovery of gastrointestinal ( GI ) function after colonic surgery . METHODS	This is an investigator-initiated , single-center , randomized , controlled , parallel group trial with assessor-blinded outcome assessment , in the Department of Urology , University Hospital Bern , Switzerland . METHODS	The study will involve 44 patients with bladder cancer scheduled for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion . METHODS	The primary outcome is the duration between the end of surgery and the return of the GI function ( first defecation ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes are fluid balance ( body weight difference postoperatively versus preoperatively ) and the incidence of kidney function disorders according to the Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End Stage Renal Disease ( RIFLE classification ) . METHODS	An equal number of patients are allocated to receive Ringerfundin solution or a glucose/potassium-based balanced crystalloid solution as baseline infusion during the entire time that intravenous administration of fluid is necessary during the perioperative period . METHODS	The randomized crystalloid solution is infused at a rate of 1 ml/kg/h until the bladder has been removed , followed by 3 ml/kg/h until the end of surgery . METHODS	Postoperative hydration is identical in both groups and consists of 1,500 ml of the randomized crystalloid solution per 24 hours . METHODS	Postoperative patient care is identical in both groups ; patients are allowed to drink clear fluids immediately after surgery , and liquid diet is started on postoperative day 1 , as well as active mobilization and the use of chewing gum . METHODS	Body weight is measured daily in the morning . METHODS	Time of first flatus and first defecation are recorded . CONCLUSIONS	This trial assesses the benefits and harms of two different balanced crystalloid solutions for perioperative fluid management in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy with urinary diversion , with regard to return of GI function and effects on postoperative renal function .

"BACKGROUND	Imatinib mesylate ( IM ) is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors . BACKGROUND	A new once-daily 400-mg film-coated tablet of imatinib has been developed by a pharmaceutical company in Korea . OBJECTIVE	The present study was designed to assess and compare the PK parameters , bioavailability , and bioequivalence of the new imatinib 400-mg formulation ( test ) versus the conventional 100-mg formulation ( reference ) administered as a single 400-mg dose in healthy adult male volunteers . METHODS	This randomized , open-label , single-dose , two-way crossover study was conducted in healthy Korean male volunteers . METHODS	Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive 400 mg of the test ( one 400-mg tablet ) or reference ( four 100-mg tablets ) formulation , followed by a 2-week washout period and administration of the alternate formulation . METHODS	Serial blood samples were collected at 0 ( predose ) , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after administration . METHODS	Plasma imatinib concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry . METHODS	The formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the 90 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) of the adjusted geometric mean ratios for Cmax , AUC ( 0-t ) , and AUC ( 0 - ) were within the predetermined range of 0.80 - 1.25 . RESULTS	In total , 35 subjects completed the study . RESULTS	No serious adverse event was reported during the study . RESULTS	The 90 % CIs of the adjusted geometric mean ratios of the test formulation to the reference formulation for C ( max ) , AUC ( 0-t ) and AUC ( 0 - ) of imatinib were all within the bioequivalence criteria range of 0.8 - 1.25 . CONCLUSIONS	The test formulation of imatinib met the Korean regulatory requirements for bioequivalence . CONCLUSIONS	Both imatinib formulations were well-tolerated in all subjects ."
"OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to compare participation rates and clinical effectiveness of sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( sEGD ) and unsedated transnasal endoscopy ( uTNE ) for esophageal assessment and Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) screening in a population-based cohort . METHODS	This was a prospective , randomized , controlled trial in a community population . METHODS	Subjects 50 years of age who previously completed validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaires were randomized ( stratified by age , sex , and reflux symptoms ) to one of three screening techniques ( either sEGD or uTNE in a mobile research van ( muTNE ) or uTNE in a hospital outpatient endoscopy suite ( huTNE ) ) and invited to participate . RESULTS	Of the 459 subjects , 209 ( 46 % ) agreed to participate ( muTNE n = 76 , huTNE n = 72 , and sEGD n = 61 ) . RESULTS	Participation rates were numerically higher in the unsedated arms of muTNE ( 47.5 % ) and huTNE ( 45.7 % ) compared with the sEGD arm ( 40.7 % ) , but were not statistically different ( P = 0.27 ) . RESULTS	Complete evaluation of the esophagus was similar using muTNE ( 99 % ) , huTNE ( 96 % ) , and sEGD ( 100 % ) techniques ( P = 0.08 ) . RESULTS	Mean recovery times ( min ) were longer for sEGD ( 67.3 ) compared with muTNE ( 15.5 ) and huTNE ( 18.5 ) ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Approximately 80 % of uTNE subjects were willing to undergo the procedure again in future . RESULTS	Respectively , 29 % and 7.8 % of participating subjects had esophagitis and BE . CONCLUSIONS	Mobile van and clinic uTNE screening had comparable clinical effectiveness with similar participation rates and safety profile to sEGD . CONCLUSIONS	Evaluation time with uTNE was significantly shorter . CONCLUSIONS	Prevalence of BE and esophagitis in community subjects 50 years of age was substantial . CONCLUSIONS	Mobile and outpatient unsedated techniques may provide an effective alternative strategy to sEGD for esophageal assessment and BE screening ."
"BACKGROUND	Pharmacokinetically guided ( PK-guided ) versus body surface area-based 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) dosing results in higher response rates and better tolerability . BACKGROUND	A paucity of data exists on PK-guided 5-FU dosing in the community setting . METHODS	Seventy colorectal cancer patients , from one academic and five community cancer centers , received the mFOLFOX6 regimen ( 5-FU 2,400 mg/m ( 2 ) over 46 hours every 2 weeks ) with or without bevacizumab at cycle 1 . METHODS	The 5-FU continuous-infusion dose was adjusted for cycles 2-4 using a PK-guided algorithm to achieve a literature-based target area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) . METHODS	The primary objective was to demonstrate that PK-guided 5-FU dosing improves the ability to achieve a target AUC within four cycles of therapy . METHODS	The secondary objective was to demonstrate reduced incidence of 5-FU-related toxicities . RESULTS	At cycles 1 and 4 , 27.7 % and 46.8 % of patients achieved the target AUC ( 20-25 mg hour/L ) , respectively ( odds ratio [ OR ] : 2.20 ; p = .046 ) . RESULTS	Significantly more patients were within range at cycle 4 compared with a literature rate of 20 % ( p < .0001 ) . RESULTS	Patients had significantly higher odds of not being underdosed at cycle 4 versus cycle 1 ( OR : 2.29 ; p = .037 ) . RESULTS	The odds of a patient being within range increased by 30 % at each subsequent cycle ( OR : 1.30 ; p = .03 ) . RESULTS	Less grade 3/4 mucositis and diarrhea were observed compared with historical data ( 1.9 % vs 16 % and 5.6 % vs 12 % , respectively ) ; however , rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia were similar ( 33 % vs 25 % -50 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	PK-guided 5-FU dosing resulted in significantly fewer underdosed patients and less gastrointestinal toxicity and allows for the application of personalized colorectal cancer therapy in the community setting ."
"BACKGROUND	The evaluation of intestinal trophism , mainly the mucosal layer , is an important issue in various conditions associated with injury , atrophy , recovery , and healing of the gut . BACKGROUND	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetics of the proliferation and apoptosis of enterocytes by immunohistochemistry and to assess the complexity of intestinal mucosa by fractal dimension ( FD ) analysis in Solea solea fed different experimental diets . RESULTS	Histomorphological evaluation of all intestinal segments did not show signs of degeneration or inflammation . RESULTS	Cell proliferation index and FD were significantly reduced with a diet high in mussel meal ( MM ; p = 0.0034 and p = 0.01063 , respectively ) , while apoptotic index did not show any significant difference for the same comparison ( p = 0.3859 ) . RESULTS	Linear regression analysis between apoptotic index ( independent variable ) and FD ( dependent variable ) showed a statistically significant inverse relationship ( p = 0.002528 ) . RESULTS	Linear regression analysis between cell proliferation index ( independent variable ) and FD ( dependent variable ) did not show any significant correlation ( p = 0.131582 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The results demonstrated that diets containing increasing levels of mussel meal in substitution of fishmeal did not incite a hyperplastic response of the intestinal mucosa . CONCLUSIONS	The mussel meal , which is derived from molluscs , could mimic the characteristics of the sole 's natural prey , being readily digestible , even without increasing the absorptive surface of intestinal mucosa . CONCLUSIONS	Interestingly , from this study emerged that FD could be used as a numeric indicator complementary to in situ quantification methods to measure intestinal trophism , in conjunction with functional parameters ."

"BACKGROUND	Acid suppressant drugs are a mainstay of treatment for cats with gastrointestinal erosion and ulceration . BACKGROUND	However , clinical studies have not been performed to compare the efficacy of commonly PO administered acid suppressants in cats . OBJECTIVE	To compare the effect of PO administered famotidine , fractionated omeprazole tablet ( fOT ) , and omeprazole reformulated paste ( ORP ) on intragastric pH in cats . OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that both omeprazole formulations would be superior to famotidine and placebo . METHODS	Six healthy adult DSH colony cats . METHODS	Utilizing a randomized , 4-way crossover design , cats received 0.88-1 .26 mg/kg PO q12h fOT , ORP , famotidine , and placebo ( lactose capsules ) . METHODS	Intragastric pH monitoring was used to continuously record intragastric pH for 96 hours beginning on day 4 of treatment . METHODS	Plasma omeprazole concentrations at steady state ( day 7 ) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with ultraviolet detection . METHODS	Mean percentage time that intragastric pH was 3 and 4 were compared among groups using ANOVA with a posthoc Tukey-Kramer test ( = 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The mean percentage time SD that intragastric pH was 3 was 68.4 35.0 % for fOT , 73.9 23.2 % for ORP , 42.8 18.6 % for famotidine , and 16.0 14.2 % for placebo . RESULTS	Mean SD plasma omeprazole concentrations were similar in cats receiving fOT compared to those receiving ORP and in a range associated with acid suppression reported in other studies . CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that both omeprazole formulations provide superior acid suppression in cats compared to famotidine or placebo . CONCLUSIONS	Fractionated enteric-coated OT is an effective acid suppressant despite disruption of the enteric coating ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of nedaplatin ( NDP ) concurrent with radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal carcinoma . METHODS	Sixty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma were randomized into either a NDP group ( n = 34 ) or a cisplatin ( DDP ) group ( n = 34 ) . METHODS	The NDP group received NDP 80-100 mg/m iv on day 1 + leucovorin ( CF ) 100 mg/m iv on days 1-5 + 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) 500 mg/m iv on days 1-5 . METHODS	The DDP group received DDP 30 mg/m iv on days 1-3 + CF 100 mg/m on days 1-5 + 5-FU 500 mg/m iv on days 1-5 . METHODS	The treatment was repeated every 4 wk in both groups . METHODS	Concurrent radiotherapy [ 60-66 Gy / ( 30-33 f ) / ( 6-7 wk ) ] was given during chemotherapy . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the short-term response rate between the NDP group and DDP group ( 90.9 % vs 81.3 % , P = 0.528 ) . RESULTS	Although the 1 - and 2-year survival rates were higher in the NDP group than in the DDP group ( 75.8 % vs 68.8 % , 57.6 % vs 50.0 % ) , the difference in the overall survival rate was not statistically significant between the two groups ( P = 0.540 ) . RESULTS	The incidences of nausea , vomiting and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower in the NDP group than in the DDP group ( 17.6 % vs 50.0 % , P = 0.031 ; 11.8 % vs 47.1 % , P = 0.016 ; 8.8 % vs 38.2 % , P = 0.039 ) . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the incidence of myelosuppression , radiation-induced esophagitis or radiation-induced pneumonia between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	NDP-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is effective and well-tolerated in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma . CONCLUSIONS	NDP-based regimen has comparable efficacy to DDP-based regimen but is associated with lower incidences of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity ."
"OBJECTIVE	Currently , there is no consensus concerning the possible beneficial colonic and systemic effects of prebiotic-containing infant formula . OBJECTIVE	This study assesses whether the feeding of a galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) - containing infant formula ( 0.44 g/dl of GOS ) and the subsequent feeding of a GOS-containing follow-on formula ( 0.50 g/dl of GOS ) have a prebiotic effect on intestinal microbiota that helps to decrease infections and allergy manifestations in healthy infants during the first year of life . METHODS	A multicentre , randomised , double-blind and placebo-controlled trial was carried out on 365 healthy term infants enrolled before 8 weeks of age and randomly assigned to a formula with or without GOS , until 12 months of age . METHODS	The incidence of infections and allergy manifestations , the antibiotics prescribed and faecal characteristics were recorded up to 12 months of age , while faecal samples were collected up to 4 months for the measurement of secretory immunoglobulin A , short-chain fatty acids and microbiota . RESULTS	A prebiotic effect on the faecal analysis was observed at 4 months of life . RESULTS	The GOS group showed a lower faecal pH ( P = 0.019 ) , a lower decreasing trend in secretory immunoglobulin A ( P = 0.078 ) , lower butyric acid concentration ( P = 0.040 ) and an increase in Bifidobacterium counts ( P = 0.010 ) . RESULTS	Changes in faecal characteristics involved greater frequency ( P < 0.001 ) and softer consistency ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The incidence of infections or allergic manifestations during the first year of life was similar in both groups , with no statistical differences ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The feeding of GOS-containing infant formula produced a definite prebiotic effect consisting of changes in faecal composition and microbiota , and in faecal consistency and the frequency of defaecation . CONCLUSIONS	No changes in the incidence of infection or allergic manifestation during the first year of life were observed ."
"BACKGROUND	Coadministration of a bacterial adjuvant with oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) has been suggested as a potential treatment for food allergy . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate a combined therapy comprising a probiotic together with peanut OIT . METHODS	We performed a double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC 1.3724 and peanut OIT ( probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy [ PPOIT ] ) in children ( 1-10 years ) with peanut allergy . METHODS	The primary outcome was induction of sustained unresponsiveness 2 to 5 weeks after discontinuation of treatment ( referred to as possible sustained unresponsiveness ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were desensitization , peanut skin prick test , and specific IgE and specific IgG4 measurements . RESULTS	Sixty-two children were randomized and stratified by age ( 5 and > 5 years ) and peanut skin test wheal size ( 10 and > 10 mm ) ; 56 reached the trial 's end . RESULTS	Baseline demographics were similar across groups . RESULTS	Possible sustained unresponsiveness was achieved in 82.1 % receiving PPOIT and 3.6 % receiving placebo ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	Nine children need to be treated for 7 to achieve sustained unresponsiveness ( number needed to treat , 1.27 ; 95 % CI , 1.06-1 .59 ) . RESULTS	Of the subjects , 89.7 % receiving PPOIT and 7.1 % receiving placebo were desensitized ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	PPOIT was associated with reduced peanut skin prick test responses and peanut-specific IgE levels and increased peanut-specific IgG4 levels ( all P < .001 ) . RESULTS	PPOIT-treated participants reported a greater number of adverse events , mostly with maintenance home dosing . CONCLUSIONS	This is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the novel coadministration of a probiotic and peanut OIT and assessing sustained unresponsiveness in children with peanut allergy . CONCLUSIONS	PPOIT was effective in inducing possible sustained unresponsiveness and immune changes that suggest modulation of the peanut-specific immune response . CONCLUSIONS	Further work is required to confirm sustained unresponsiveness after a longer period of secondary peanut elimination and to clarify the relative contributions of probiotics versus OIT ."
"OBJECTIVE	This study sought to report additional safety results from the ROCKET AF ( Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation ) . BACKGROUND	The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated similar risks of stroke/systemic embolism and major/nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding ( principal safety endpoint ) with rivaroxaban and warfarin . METHODS	The risk of the principal safety and component bleeding endpoints with rivaroxaban versus warfarin were compared , and factors associated with major bleeding were examined in a multivariable model . RESULTS	The principal safety endpoint was similar in the rivaroxaban and warfarin groups ( 14.9 vs. 14.5 events/100 patient-years ; hazard ratio : 1.03 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.96 to 1.11 ) . RESULTS	Major bleeding risk increased with age , but there were no differences between treatments in each age category ( < 65 , 65 to 74,75 years ; pinteraction = 0.59 ) . RESULTS	Compared with those without ( n = 13,455 ) , patients with a major bleed ( n = 781 ) were more likely to be older , current/prior smokers , have prior gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding , mild anemia , and a lower calculated creatinine clearance and less likely to be female or have a prior stroke/transient ischemic attack . RESULTS	Increasing age , baseline diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) 90 mm Hg , history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or GI bleeding , prior acetylsalicylic acid use , and anemia were independently associated with major bleeding risk ; female sex and DBP < 90 mm Hg were associated with a decreased risk . CONCLUSIONS	Rivaroxaban and warfarin had similar risk for major/nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding . CONCLUSIONS	Age , sex , DBP , prior GI bleeding , prior acetylsalicylic acid use , and anemia were associated with the risk of major bleeding . CONCLUSIONS	( An Efficacy and Safety Study of Rivaroxaban With Warfarin for the Prevention of Stroke and Non-Central Nervous System Systemic Embolism in Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation : NCT00403767 ) ."

BACKGROUND	Milbemycin oxime and praziquantel are routinely used to control Dirofilaria immitis and intestinal worm infections in dogs . BACKGROUND	The safety of concurrent use of fluralaner and a commercially available milbemycin oxime plus praziquantel combination tablet , in particular with regard to gastrointestinal symptoms , was investigated using oral doses at or above the maximum recommended rates . RESULTS	Some minor and transient clinical findings were observed during the study period ; however , none of these was considered to be related to concurrent treatment with fluralaner and milbemycin oxime plus praziquantel , or to the use of either product alone . CONCLUSIONS	Concurrent treatment with fluralaner , milbemycin oxime and praziquantel is well tolerated in dogs ."
"OBJECTIVE	Nut consumption has been found to decrease risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes and to promote healthy body weights possibly related to their favorable macronutrient profile . OBJECTIVE	We therefore assessed the effect of pistachios on postprandial glucose and insulin levels , gut hormones related to satiety and endothelial function . METHODS	In this randomized crossover study , 20 subjects with metabolic syndrome consumed five study meals over 5-10 weeks . METHODS	The meals differed in fat type and quantity , but were matched according to available carbohydrates ( CHOs ) . METHODS	Three meals had 50 g available CHO : white bread ( WB50g ) , white bread , butter and cheese ( WB+B+C h ) and white bread and pistachios ( WB+P ) . METHODS	Two meals had 12 g available CHO : white bread ( WB12g ) and pistachios ( P ) . RESULTS	Within each group of available CHO meals , postprandial glucose levels were the highest following the white bread-only meals , and glucose response was significantly attenuated when butter and cheese or pistachios were consumed ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Postprandial insulin levels were highest after the WB+B+C h meal ( P < 0.05 ) , but did not differ between the white bread-only and pistachio meals . RESULTS	Both endothelial function ( reactive hyperemia index ) and arterial stiffness ( augmentation index ) significantly increased after the white bread-only meals compared with the WB+B+C h meal ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Insulin secretagogue levels were higher when butter and cheese or pistachios were consumed than when white bread only was consumed ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Compared with white bread , pistachio consumption reduced postprandial glycemia , increased glucagon-like-peptide levels and may have insulin-sparing properties . CONCLUSIONS	These effects could be beneficial for individuals with diabetes and metabolic syndrome ."
"OBJECTIVE	This study was performed to compare the mucosal findings after esophagogastroduodenoscopy in two groups before and after the use of alendronate only and following administration of the enteric-coated alendronate ( 5 mg ) and calcitriol ( 0.5 g ) combined drug ( Maxmarvil , Yuyu Co. ) . METHODS	The study population consisted of 33 postmenopausal healthy female volunteers , aged 50 to 70 years ( mean age , 58 5 ) without gastrointestinal symptoms and with normal baseline endoscopic findings . METHODS	Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed at baseline and was repeated 2 weeks later after daily intake of Maxmarvil ( n = 17 subjects ) or alendronate only ( n = 16 subjects ) . METHODS	Mucosal injury scores were reported by an endoscopist after 2 weeks of treatment with each medication schedule . RESULTS	Esophageal mucosal injuries developed in two of 16 subjects in the alendronate only group and 0 of 17 in the Maxmarvil group . RESULTS	Gastric mucosal injuries developed in eight subjects in the alendronate group and four subjects in the Maxmarvil group ; this difference was statistically significant . CONCLUSIONS	The mucosal damage scores for the alendronate group ( total score 24 ) were significantly higher than those for the Maxmarvil group ( total score 9 ) in the esophagus and stomach . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , this study suggested that enteric-coated Maxmarvil is less harmful to gastrointestinal mucosa than alendronate , and may improve the tolerability of osteoporosis medication in clinical practice ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of oral glutamine ( GL ) supplementation on gut permeability and endotoxemia ( surrogate end point ) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis . METHODS	In a randomized controlled trial , patients were randomized to be given placebo or GL for 7 days . METHODS	The primary outcome measures include the effect on gut permeability ( assessed by lactulose/mannitol excretion in urine and endotoxemia assessed by endotoxin core antibodies type IgG and IgM ( EndoCab IgG and IgM ) . METHODS	The secondary outcome measures include infectious complications , mortality , total hospital/intensive care unit stay , C-reactive protein , and prealbumin levels . RESULTS	Patients were assigned to GL ( n = 41 ) and placebo ( n = 39 ) groups . RESULTS	There was no change in gut permeability after the intervention . RESULTS	However , the EndoCab IgM levels increased significantly ( 33 [ 4 , 175 ] to 40 [ 8 , 350 ] GMU/mL ; P = 0.0164 ) and the C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly ( 133 [ 1 , 287 ] to 88 [ 1 , 267 ] ng/mL ; P = 0.0236 ) in the GL group . RESULTS	No difference was observed in infectious complication , prealbumin value , hospital/intensive care unit stay , and mortality in both groups . CONCLUSIONS	No significant trend was identified for an effect of GL on gut permeability . CONCLUSIONS	Decreased inflammation and endotoxemia did not translate into reduced infectious complications in severe acute pancreatitis . CONCLUSIONS	However , the study was underpowered to detect the aforementioned difference ( trial registration : CTRI/2009/000945 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	The granisetron transdermal system ( GTS ) showed non-inferior efficacy to oral granisetron to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) during multiday chemotherapy . BACKGROUND	We compared the efficacy and safety of GTS with that of intravenous and oral granisetron in Korean patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ( MEC ) . METHODS	A total of 276 patients were randomized into GTS ( n = 139 , one patch on days 1-4 ) or control group ( n = 137 , intravenous on day 1 and oral on days 2-4 ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving complete response ( CR ) from chemotherapy initiation until 24 h after the final administration . RESULTS	Out of 234 patients ( 112 in GTS and 122 in control group ) included in the per protocol analysis , 97.9 % had gastrointestinal cancer and 76.9 % received 3-day chemotherapy . RESULTS	The GTS showed non-inferior efficacy achieving CR in 75.0 % of the patients ; 74.6 % of the patients in the control group achieved CR ( 95 % confidence interval -10.73 to 11.55 % ) . RESULTS	The CR rate did not change after subgroup analyses by sex , age , and chemotherapy naivety and analysis per day and overall days of treatment . RESULTS	The GTS group showed sustained CR from day 1 to day 4 . RESULTS	Patients ' satisfaction , assessed using Functional Living Index-Emesis ( FLI-E ) , showed no difference . RESULTS	Both treatments were well tolerated and safe . CONCLUSIONS	The GTS showed non-inferior efficacy to intravenous and oral granisetron . CONCLUSIONS	The safety , tolerability , and FLI-E scores of the GTS were comparable to those of control group . CONCLUSIONS	The GTS offers a convenient alternative option for relieving CINV in patients receiving MEC ."
"OBJECTIVE	Little is known about the effects of natural mineral water on constipation in adults . OBJECTIVE	We assessed the effect of a magnesium sulfate-rich natural mineral water ( Hpar ; Nestl Waters , Issy-les-Moulineaux , France ) on gastrointestinal transit in constipated women . METHODS	We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Hpar in outpatients with functional constipation ( based on the Rome III criteria ) . METHODS	The study included 244 female patients , age 18 to 60 years , identified by 62 general practitioners throughout France . METHODS	After a washout period , subjects drank 1.5 L natural low-mineral water daily ( control , n = 77 ) , 0.5 L Hpar and 1 L natural low-mineral water daily ( Hpar 0.5 group , n = 85 ) , or 1 L Hpar and 0.5 L natural low-mineral water daily ( Hpar 1 group , n = 82 ) for 4 weeks . METHODS	We collected information on the number and types of stools , abdominal pain , rescue medications , adverse events , and volume of water consumed . RESULTS	We observed no significant effect at week 1 . RESULTS	At week 2 , constipation was reduced in 21.1 % of patients in the control group , in 30.9 % in the Hpar 0.5 group ( P = .099 vs controls ) , and in 37.5 % in the Hpar 1 group ( P = .013 vs controls ) . RESULTS	The Hpar 1 group also had a decreased number of hard or lumpy stools ( Bristol scale , P = .030 vs baseline ) and a substantial decrease in the use of rescue medication ( P = .034 vs controls ) . RESULTS	Patient responses correlated with magnesium sulfate concentrations . RESULTS	Safety was very good ; there were no serious adverse events among patients who drank Hpar . CONCLUSIONS	In a controlled trial , daily consumption of 1 L Hpar reduced constipation and hard or lumpy stools in a greater percentage of women with functional constipation than natural low-mineral water , as early as the second week of treatment ."
"BACKGROUND	Endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response have been recently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel diseases in adults . BACKGROUND	We aimed at assessing the involvement of these pathways also in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease by analysing the expression of the main genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and correlating them with the degree of intestinal inflammation . METHODS	Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis of the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker HSPA5 and of selected genes representing the three pathways of unfolded protein response ( IRE-XBP1 , PERK-ATF4 , ATF6p90-p50 ) in inflamed and uninflamed biopsies from 28 inflammatory bowel disease paediatric patients and 10 controls . RESULTS	HSPA5 , PDIA4 , as well as unspliced and spliced XBP1 mRNAs were significantly increased in patients ' inflamed colonic mucosa compared to uninflamed mucosa and controls . RESULTS	HSPA5 , PDIA4 , ATF6 , and phospho-IRE proteins were also upregulated , indicating the activation of the IRE-XBP1 and ATF6p90-p50 branches of unfolded protein response . RESULTS	A positive significant correlation between interleukin-8 levels , as a marker of inflammation , and upregulated genes was found in the inflamed colonic mucosa . CONCLUSIONS	A deregulation of the genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response pathways may be a key component of the inflammatory response in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease ."
"BACKGROUND	In ruminants , lower ruminal pH causes massive disruption of ruminal epithelial structure during periods of feeding high-concentrate diets . BACKGROUND	However , the influence of excessive organic fatty acids in the lumen of hindgut on the epithelial structure is unclear . BACKGROUND	In this study , twelve mid-lactating goats were randomly assigned to either a HC diet group ( 65 % concentrate of dry matter ; n = 6 ) or a LC diet group ( 35 % concentrate of dry matter ; n = 6 ) for 10 weeks . BACKGROUND	The colonic epithelial structure was detected by HE staining and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and the apoptotic status of epithelial cells was estimated by TUNEL method and caspase activities . RESULTS	HC goats showed higher level of free lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in rumen fluid ( p < 0.01 ) but not in colonic digesta ( p > 0.05 ) , and higher total volatile fatty acid ( VFA ) concentrations in rumen fluid ( p < 0.05 ) and in colonic digesta ( p < 0.01 ) , and higher content of starch in colonic digesta ( p < 0.05 ) compared to LC goats . RESULTS	HC goats demonstrated profound alterations in the colonic epithelial structure and tight junctions ( TJ ) , apparently due to damage of the epithelium with widened TJs space and nuclear breakdown and mitochondrial swelling . RESULTS	HC goats showed higher level of apoptosis in the colonic epithelium with higher proportion of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and increases of caspase-3 and -3 / 7 activities , as well as the lower ratio of bcl-2 / bax mRNA expression in the colonic mucosa ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	However , - defense mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the colonic mucosa of HC goats compared to LC ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	HC goats showed higher level of TJ proteins including claudin-1 and claudin-4 in the colonic mucosa than LC ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Neither free LPS content in the colonic digesta nor NF - B protein expression in tissues showed significant difference between HC and LC goats ( p > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Our results reveal that long-term feeding HC diet to lactating goats causes severe damages to the colonic mucosa barrier associated with activating cells apoptosis ."

RESULTS	It was significantly higher than the baseline level at month 6 ( P < 0.05 ) , which was also higher than that of the control group at same period ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the ALB level in the control group ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	SCr of two groups showed an increasing trend . RESULTS	SCr of the experiment group was significantly higher at month 1 , 3 , and 6 follow-ups than the baseline level ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	But the increment of SCr was higher in the control group than in the experimental group , and obviously higher than the baseline levels ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	eGFR of both groups showed a decreasing trend . RESULTS	The decrement was higher in the control group than in the experimental group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The proportion of progression of renal functions at month 1 , 3 , and 6 of follow-ups in the experimental group was 0.0 % ( 0 case ) , 9.55 % ( 8 cases ) , and 21.4 % ( 18 cases ) , while they were 8.3 % ( 7 cases ) , 21.4 % ( 18 cases ) , and 40.5 % ( 34 cases ) in the control group . RESULTS	There was no statistical difference in the proportion of progression of renal functions between the two groups at month 3 and 6 of follow-ups ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no statistical difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	QJC could effectively reduce urinary protein of patients with stage 3b DKD , and delay the progression of renal functions ."
"OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate whether ingestion of fructose and fructans ( such as inulin ) can exacerbate irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) symptoms . OBJECTIVE	The aim was to better understand the origin of these symptoms by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the gut . METHODS	A total of 16 healthy volunteers participated in a four-way , randomized , single-blind , crossover study in which they consumed 500ml of water containing 40g of either glucose , fructose , inulin , or a 1:1 mixture of 40g glucose and 40g fructose . METHODS	MRI scans were performed hourly for 5h , assessing the volume of gastric contents , small bowel water content ( SBWC ) , and colonic gas . METHODS	Breath hydrogen ( H2 ) was measured and symptoms recorded after each scan . RESULTS	Data are reported as mean ( s.d. ) ( 95 % CI ) when normally distributed and median ( range ) when not . RESULTS	Fructose increased area under the curve ( AUC ) from 0-5h of SBWC to 71 ( 23 ) l/min , significantly greater than for glucose at 36 ( 11-132 ) l/min ( P < 0.001 ) , whereas AUC SBWC after inulin , 33 ( 17-106 ) l/min , was no different from that after glucose . RESULTS	Adding glucose to fructose decreased AUC SBWC to 55 ( 28 ) l/min ( P = 0.08 ) vs. fructose . RESULTS	Inulin substantially increased AUC colonic gas to 33 ( 20 ) l/min , significantly greater than glucose and glucose + fructose ( both P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Breath H2 rose more with inulin than with fructose . RESULTS	Glucose when combined with fructose significantly reduced breath H2 by 7,700 ( 3,121-12 ,300 ) p.p.m. / min relative to fructose alone ( P < 0.01 , n = 13 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Fructose but not inulin distends the small bowel with water . CONCLUSIONS	Adding glucose to fructose reduces the effect of fructose on SBWC and breath hydrogen . CONCLUSIONS	Inulin distends the colon with gas more than fructose , but causes few symptoms in healthy volunteers ."

OBJECTIVE	This multicenter , randomized , parallel-controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy , bacterial eradication rates and safety of biapenem and meropenem in the treatment of bacterial lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) at nine centres in China . METHODS	Patients diagnosed with bacterial lower respiratory tract infections or UTIs were randomly assigned to receive either biapenem ( 300 mg every 12 h ) or meropenem ( 500 mg every 8 h ) by intravenous infusion for 7 to 14 days according to their disease severity . METHODS	The overall clinical efficacy , bacterial eradication rates and drug-related adverse reactions of biapenem and meropenem were analyzed . RESULTS	A total of 272 enrolled cases were included in the intent-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis and safety analysis . RESULTS	There were no differences in demographics and baseline medical characteristics between biapenem group and meropenem group . RESULTS	The overall clinical efficacies of biapenem and meropenem were not significantly different , 94.70 per cent ( 125/132 ) vs. 93.94 per cent ( 124/132 ) . RESULTS	The overall bacterial eradication rates of biapenem and meropenem showed no significant difference , 96.39 per cent ( 80/83 ) vs. 93.75 per cent ( 75/80 ) . RESULTS	Drug-related adverse reactions were comparable in biapenem and meropenem groups with the incidence of 11.76 per cent ( 16/136 ) and 15.44 per cent ( 21/136 ) , respectively . RESULTS	The most common symptoms of biapenem-related adverse reactions were rash ( 2.2 % ) and gastrointestinal distress ( 1.5 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	Biapenem was non-inferior to meropenem and was well-tolerated in the treatment of moderate and severe lower respiratory tract infections and UTIs ."
"METHODS	Curcumin revealed various health-beneficial properties in numerous studies . METHODS	However its bioavailability is low due to its limited intestinal uptake and rapid metabolism . METHODS	The aim of our project was to develop novel curcumin formulations with improved oral bioavailability and to study their safety as well as potential sex-differences . RESULTS	In this crossover study , healthy subjects ( 13 women , 10 men ) took , in random order , a single oral dose of 500 mg curcuminoids as native powder , micronized powder , or liquid micelles . RESULTS	Blood and urine samples were collected for 24 h and total curcuminoids and safety parameters were quantified . RESULTS	Based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) , the micronized curcumin was 14 - , 5 - , and 9-fold and micellar curcumin 277 - , 114 - , and 185-fold better bioavailable than native curcumin in women , men , and all subjects , respectively . RESULTS	Thus , women absorbed curcumin more efficiently than men . RESULTS	All safety parameters remained within the reference ranges following the consumption of all formulations . CONCLUSIONS	Both , the micronized powder and in particular the liquid micellar formulation of curcumin significantly improved its oral bioavailability without altering safety parameters and may thus be ideally suited to deliver curcumin in human intervention trials . CONCLUSIONS	The observed sex differences in curcumin absorption warrant further investigation ."

"OBJECTIVE	The use of proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol is known to prevent the gastrointestinal complications of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) . OBJECTIVE	Rebamipide is known to increase the mucosal generation of prostaglandins and to eliminate free oxygen radicals , thus enhancing the protective function of the gastric mucosa . OBJECTIVE	However , it is unknown whether rebamipide plays a role in preventing NSAID-induced gastropathy . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of rebamipide compared to misoprostol in preventing NSAID-induced gastrointestinal complications in patients requiring continuous NSAID treatment . METHODS	We studied 479 patients who required continuous NSAID treatment . METHODS	The patients were randomly assigned to groups that received 100 mg of rebamipide three times per day or 200 g of misoprostol three times per day for 12 weeks . METHODS	The primary endpoint of the analysis was the occurrence rate of gastric ulcers , as determined by endoscopy after 12 weeks of therapy . RESULTS	Of the 479 patients in the study , 242 received rebamipide , and 237 received misoprostol . RESULTS	Ultimately , 44 patients ( 18.6 % ) withdrew from the misoprostol group and 25 patients ( 10.3 % ) withdrew from the rebamipide group . RESULTS	There was a significant difference in withdrawal rate between the two groups ( p = 0.0103 ) . RESULTS	The per protocol analysis set was not valid because of the dropout rate of the misoprostol group ; thus , the intention to treat ( ITT ) analysis set is the main set for the efficacy analysis in this study . RESULTS	After 12 weeks , the occurrence rate of gastric ulcers was similar in the rebamipide and misoprostol groups ( 20.3 % vs 21.9 % , p = 0.6497 ) according to ITT analysis . RESULTS	In addition , the therapeutic failure rate was similar in the rebamipide and misoprostol groups ( 13.6 % vs 13.1 % , p = 0.8580 ) . RESULTS	The total severity score of the gastrointestinal symptoms was significantly lower in the rebamipide group than in the misoprostol group ( p = 0.0002 ) . RESULTS	The amount of antacid used was significantly lower in the rebamipide group than in the misoprostol group ( p = 0.0258 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Rebamipide can prevent gastric ulcers when used with NSAIDs and can decrease the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with NSAID administration . CONCLUSIONS	When the possibility of poor compliance and the potential adverse effects of misoprostol are considered , rebamipide appears to be a clinically effective and safe alternative ."
"OBJECTIVE	Levels of stool fatty acid soaps and beneficial bacteria differ between formula-fed and breast-fed infants ; addition of specific formula ingredients may reduce these differences . OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the effects of a term infant formula containing high sn-2 palmitate term infant formula ( sn-2 ) or an identical formula supplemented with oligofructose ( OF ) at 2 concentrations ( sn-2 +3 g/L OF , sn-2 +5 g/L OF ) on stool composition , stool characteristics , and fecal bifidobacteria . METHODS	Healthy , term formula-fed infants 7 to 14 days old ( n = 300 ) were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive standard formula ( control ) , sn-2 , sn-2 +3 g/L OF , or sn-2 +5 g/L OF for 8 weeks . METHODS	Human milk ( HM ) - fed infants ( n = 75 ) were studied in parallel . METHODS	Stool samples were collected from all subjects at week 8 for fatty acid soaps and mineral content , and from a subset at baseline and week 8 for bifidobacteria . METHODS	Stool characteristics were assessed via 3-day diary . RESULTS	The sn-2 group had 46 % less stool soap palmitate ( P < 0.001 ) and softer stools than control ( 20 % more mushy soft stools , P = 0.026 ; 50 % fewer formed stools , P = 0.003 ) . RESULTS	Addition of OF resulted in even fewer formed stools versus control ( 65 % fewer for sn-2 +3 g/L OF , 79 % fewer for sn-2 +5 g/L OF ) , with 5 g/L OF more closely resembling that of HM-fed infants . RESULTS	Both sn-2 ( P < 0.05 ) and sn-2 with OF groups ( P < 0.01 ) had significantly higher fecal bifidobacteria concentrations than control at week 8 , not differing from HM-fed infants . CONCLUSIONS	High sn-2-palmitate formulas led to reduced stool soaps , softer stools , and increased bifidobacteria , whereas addition of OF further improved stool consistency . CONCLUSIONS	Those modifications brought outcomes in formula-fed infants closer to that in HM-fed infants ."
"OBJECTIVE	Children are vulnerable to diet inadequacies , which may affect immune function . OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to determine if a follow-up formula ( FUF ) containing DHA , the prebiotics PDX and GOS , and yeast - glucan affects incidence of respiratory infections and diarrheal disease in healthy children . METHODS	In a double-blind , randomized , controlled , prospective trial , 3-4 year old children were fed 3 servings per day of either a FUF with 25 mg DHA , 1.2 g PDX/GOS , and 8.7 mg yeast - glucan per serving or an unfortified , cow 's milk-based beverage ( control ) for 28 weeks . METHODS	Fecal and blood samples were collected to assess immune markers and iron/zinc status . METHODS	Incidence of acute respiratory infections ( ARI ) , diarrheal disease , and antibiotic treatment were obtained from medical records . RESULTS	The FUF group had fewer episodes and shorter duration of ARI ( mean days [ SE ] ; control = 4.3 [ 0.2 ] ; FUF = 3.5 [ 0.2 ] ; P = .007 ) , less antibiotic use ( n [ % ] ; control = 21 [ 14 % ] ; FUF = 8 [ 5 % ] ; P = .01 ) , and fewer missed days of day care due to illness . RESULTS	No diarrheal disease was diagnosed in either group . RESULTS	The FUF group had higher interleukin-10 and white blood cell count at the end of the study . RESULTS	There were no differences in hemoglobin , serum ferritin and zinc , or fecal secretory immunoglobulin A. CONCLUSIONS	Daily consumption of a FUF was associated with fewer episodes and shorter duration of ARI , as well as less antibiotic use . CONCLUSIONS	The children who consumed the FUF had increased interleukin-10 and white blood cells , suggesting an antiinflammatory mechanism and/or an increase of effector immune cells ."

METHODS	A prospective randomised controlled study was conducted on 240 children with a confirmed diagnosis of Hp infection . METHODS	These patients were randomized into triple therapy ( n = 120 ) and probiotics groups ( n = 120 ) . METHODS	The triple therapy group received amoxicillin [ 40mg / ( kgd ) , Tid ] , clarithromycin [ 15mg / ( kgd ) , Bid ] and omeprazole [ 0.7-0 .8 mg / ( kgd ) , Qd ] , while the probiotics group received Saccharomyces boulardii ( 250mg , Bid ) in addition to triple therapy . METHODS	The course of treatment was 14 days in both groups . METHODS	The adverse events in subjects were recorded by their parents during treatment . METHODS	Hp eradiation was evaluated by ( 13 ) C breath test at 4 weeks after treatment , and the eradication rate and incidence of adverse events were compared between the two groups . RESULTS	The Hp eradication rates were 75.8 % ( 91/120 ) in the triple therapy group and 85 % ( 102/120 ) in the probiotics group ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Compared with the triple therapy group , the probiotics group had nonsignificantly lower incidence of nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain ( P > 0.05 ) and significantly lower incidence of stomatitis , constipation and diarrhea ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Triple therapy combined with Saccharomyces boulardii can not significantly increase Hp eradication rate , but can significantly reduce the incidence of stomatitis , constipation , and diarrhea during treatment ."
"OBJECTIVE	Oral feeding is likely to have an impact on early return of normal bowel function after uncomplicated surgery including cesarean section . OBJECTIVE	This study compared postoperative outcomes of early versus late oral feeding regimes after cesarean section . METHODS	In this clinical trial , 140 pregnant women who underwent elective cesarean section with regional anesthesia were randomized into two feeding groups . METHODS	In the early oral and delayed oral feeding groups , liquid diets were commenced 2 and 8 h after surgery , respectively . METHODS	Patients able to tolerate the liquid diet were then gradually introduced to the regular diet . METHODS	Main clinical outcomes included duration of hospital stay , time to return of normal bowel function and postoperative gastrointestinal complications . RESULTS	Time to return of bowel movement ( 7.8 2.9 vs 11.7 5 h , P < 0.0001 ) and time to mobilization ( 10.7 7.7 vs 13.5 5.9 h , P = 0.015 ) occurred significantly earlier in the early feeding group . CONCLUSIONS	Early oral feeding reduces the time required for return of normal bowel function . CONCLUSIONS	This is without significant detrimental effects on the incidence of gastrointestinal complications ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare in dual-energy CT ( DECT ) conventionally reconstructed polyenergetic images ( PEI ) at 120 kVp to virtual monoenergetic images ( MEI ) at different kiloelectron volt ( keV ) levels for evaluation of liver and gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) hepatic metastases with regard to objective ( IQob ) and subjective image quality ( IQsub ) assessed by two readers of varying experience . OBJECTIVE	Image quality was correlated to patient size and compared between PEI and MEI . METHODS	From 50 examinations of 17 GIST patients ( 12 with hepatic metastases ) undergoing abdominal dual-source DECT for staging , therapy monitoring or follow-up , PEI and nine MEI in 10-keV intervals from 40 to 120 keV were reconstructed . METHODS	Liver contrast-to-noise ratios ( CNR ) and metastasis-to-liver ratios were calculated . METHODS	MEI reconstructions with the highest IQob were compared to PEI for IQsub by one experienced reader ( ER ) and one inexperienced reader ( IR ) . METHODS	Patients ' diameters were correlated to IQob and IQsub ratings . RESULTS	MEI at 70 keV had the highest IQob with equal liver CNR and metastasis-to-liver ratio compared to PEI . RESULTS	The ER rated 70-keV MEI and PEI equally high ( median 4 ) , whereas the IR rated IQsub best in 70-keV MEI ( median 5 ) . RESULTS	Unlike in PEI , IQsub ratings in 70-keV MEI were not correlated to patient size . CONCLUSIONS	MEI at 70 keV provided an IQob equivalent to PEI . CONCLUSIONS	Regarding the IR , IQsub was improved in 70-keV MEI compared to PEI and less dependent on patient size . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , IRs might improve their diagnostic confidence in the assessment of hepatic GIST metastases by evaluating MEI reconstructions at 70 keV ."
"BACKGROUND	Food residue in the remnant stomach after subtotal gastrectomy ( STG ) interferes with endoscopic observation . BACKGROUND	We investigated whether intravenous erythromycin improves gastric mucosa visualization in patients with STG . METHODS	This study was conducted from April 2012 to October 2012 as a double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomized trial . METHODS	Patients who received STG with complete resection ( stage T1-2N0M0 ) were included . METHODS	Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus , neurologic disease , myopathy , recent viral enteritis history , concomitant therapy influencing gastrointestinal motility and severe comorbidity . METHODS	Patients were instructed to consume a soft diet for dinner between 1800 and 2000 h , and endoscopies were performed between 0900 and 1200 h. Patients were assigned randomly to receive either erythromycin ( 125 mg in normal saline 50 cc ) or placebo saline . METHODS	The endoscopy was performed 15 min after infusion . METHODS	Grade of residual food was rated as follows : G0 , no residual food ; G1 , a small amount of residual food ; G2 , a moderate amount of residual food ; G3 , a moderate amount of residual food that hinders observation of the entire surface , even with body rolling ; G4 , a great amount of residual food such that endoscopic observation is impossible . RESULTS	When good visibility was defined as G0 + G1 , visibility was significantly better in the erythromycin group ( 61 + 19 % ) than in the placebo group ( 38 + 12 % , p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	However , this effect was not seen in patients within 6 months after gastrectomy . RESULTS	The risk factor for food stasis in the placebo group ( n = 58 ) was food stasis at last endoscopy . RESULTS	The only factor predicting erythromycin response in the erythromycin group ( n = 56 ) was elapsed time since surgery . RESULTS	Adverse effects included nausea [ 11 ( 19.7 % ) ] and vomiting [ 1 ( 1.8 % ) ] in the erythromycin group and vomiting [ 3 ( 5.2 % ) ] in the placebo group . RESULTS	However , they were transient and tolerable . CONCLUSIONS	Premedication with erythromycin improves mucosal visualization during endoscopy in patients with STG . BACKGROUND	NCT01659619 ) ."
"OBJECTIVE	Antibiotic resistance is the main reason for failure of Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) treatment . OBJECTIVE	Currently , guidelines recommend a treatment guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing after two failures . OBJECTIVE	However , microbial culture is not feasible everywhere , and the limited number of effective antibiotics against the bacterium narrows the options ; thus a rescue therapy combining antibiotics with a low resistance may be fitting . METHODS	Patients who have failed a first-line treatment ( either prolonged triple or sequential regimens ) and , successively , a levofloxacin-based triple therapy were considered for the study . METHODS	Subjects underwent urea breath test ( UBT ) , stool antigen test ( ST ) and endoscopy/histology to confirm the diagnosis . METHODS	Cytopenia and impaired liver and kidney function were exclusion criteria . METHODS	Fifty-four subjects were randomized 1:1 to two regimens : RMB Rabeprazole/Rifabutin/Minocycline / Bismuth sub-citrate or MTB Rabeprazole/Tinidazole/Minocycline / Bismuth sub-citrate both for 10 days . METHODS	The results were checked 6 weeks after the end of therapy with ST/UBT plus endoscopy when indicated . RESULTS	RMB eradicated the bacterium in 21 patients . RESULTS	Two subjects dropped out . RESULTS	The eradication rate was 77.7 % ( CI 62.0-93 .4 % ) at intention-to-treat and 84.0 % ( CI 69.6-98 .4 % ) at per-protocol analysis . RESULTS	MTB was successful in 14 patients ( 51.9 % , CI 33.1-70 .7 % ) . RESULTS	No patient withdrew from the treatment for adverse events . RESULTS	Drug-related side effects were reported only in 3 subjects , but in all cases the treatment was carried on . CONCLUSIONS	The association minocycline/rifabutin seems to have a synergic effect and a good therapeutic outcome in patients who have failed at least two previous regimens , although a trial on a large population is needed ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the 4-year results following a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) comparing open ( ONF ) and laparoscopic ( LNF ) Nissen fundoplication in children . BACKGROUND	It is assumed that long-term results of ONF and LNF are comparable . BACKGROUND	No randomised studies have been performed in children . METHODS	A follow-up study was performed in children randomised to ONF or LNF ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00259961 ) . METHODS	Recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux ( GER ) was documented by upper gastrointestinal contrast study and/or 24-h pH study . METHODS	Nutritional status , retching and other symptoms were investigated . METHODS	A questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life before and after surgery . RESULTS	Thirty-nine children were randomised to ONF ( n = 20 ) or LNF ( n = 19 ) . RESULTS	There were 15 ONF and 16 LNF neurologically impaired children . RESULTS	One patient ( ONF group ) was lost to follow-up . RESULTS	Follow-up was 4.1 years ( 3.1-5 .3 ) for ONF group and 4.1 years ( 2.6-5 .1 ) for LNF group ( p = 0.9 ) . RESULTS	Seven neurologically impaired children had died by the time of follow-up ( 3 ONF , 4 LNF ) . RESULTS	Incidence of recurrent GER was 12.5 % in the ONF and 20 % in the LNF ( p = ns ) .

"OBJECTIVE	Gut microbiota provides beneficial effects under physiological conditions , but is able to contribute to inflammatory diseases in susceptible individuals . OBJECTIVE	Thus , we designed this study to test whether additional intake of symbiotic gel affects specific modifications of gut microbiota in patients with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . METHODS	Eighteen patients with ESRD diagnosis with renal replacement therapy ( hemodialysis ) were included in this study . METHODS	They were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups : ( 1 ) test group ( nutritional counseling + symbiotic ) and ( 2 ) control group ( nutritional counseling + placebo ) . METHODS	Clinical history and the evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale were performed . METHODS	Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction from fecal samples . METHODS	All subjects were followed for 2months . RESULTS	Bifidobacterial counts were higher in the second samples ( mean : 5.51.72 log10 cells/g ) than in first samples ( 4.20.88 log 10cells/g ) in the patients of the test group ( P = .0344 ) . RESULTS	Also , lactobacilli counts had a little decrease in the test group ( 2.30.75 to 2.00.88 log 10 cells/g ) and the control group ( 2.20.90 to 1.81.33 log 10 cells/g ) , between the first and the second samples . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal symptoms scores ( scale 8-40 ) were reduced in the test group ( start 12 [ 10-14 ] and end 9 [ 8-10 ] ) compared with control group ( start 11 [ 8-21 ] and end 11 [ 9-15 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	Short-term symbiotic treatment in patients with ESRD can lead to the increase of Bifidobacterium counts , maintaining the intestinal microbial balance ."
"BACKGROUND	Epidemiology associates whole-grain ( WG ) consumption with several health benefits . BACKGROUND	Mounting evidence suggests that WG wheat polyphenols play a role in mechanisms underlying health benefits . OBJECTIVE	The objective was to assess circulating concentration , excretion , and the physiologic role of WG wheat polyphenols in subjects with suboptimal dietary and lifestyle behaviors . METHODS	A placebo-controlled , parallel-group randomized trial with 80 healthy overweight/obese subjects with low intake of fruit and vegetables and sedentary lifestyle was performed . METHODS	Participants replaced precise portions of refined wheat ( RW ) with a fixed amount of selected WG wheat or RW products for 8 wk . METHODS	At baseline and every 4 wk , blood , urine , feces , and anthropometric and body composition measures were collected . METHODS	Profiles of phenolic acids in biological samples , plasma markers of metabolic disease and inflammation , and fecal microbiota composition were assessed . RESULTS	WG consumption for 4-8 wk determined a 4-fold increase in serum dihydroferulic acid ( DHFA ) and a 2-fold increase in fecal ferulic acid ( FA ) compared with RW consumption ( no changes ) . RESULTS	Similarly , urinary FA at 8 wk doubled the baseline concentration only in WG subjects . RESULTS	Concomitant reduction in plasma tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) after 8 wk and increased interleukin ( IL ) -10 only after 4 wk with WG compared with RW ( P = 0.04 ) were observed . RESULTS	No significant change in plasma metabolic disease markers over the study period was observed , but a trend toward lower plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 with higher excretion of FA and DHFA in the WG group was found . RESULTS	Fecal FA was associated with baseline low Bifidobacteriales and Bacteroidetes abundances , whereas after WG consumption , it correlated with increased Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes but reduced Clostridium . RESULTS	TNF - reduction correlated with increased Bacteroides and Lactobacillus . RESULTS	No effect of dietary interventions on anthropometric measurements and body composition was found . CONCLUSIONS	WG wheat consumption significantly increased excreted FA and circulating DHFA . CONCLUSIONS	Bacterial communities influenced fecal FA and were modified by WG wheat consumption . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01293175 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Crohn 's disease ( CD ) usually recurs after intestinal resection ; postoperative endoscopic monitoring and tailored treatment can reduce the chance of recurrence . OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether monitoring levels of fecal calprotectin ( FC ) can substitute for endoscopic analysis of the mucosa . METHODS	We analyzed data collected from 135 participants in a prospective , randomized , controlled trial , performed at 17 hospitals in Australia and 1 hospital in New Zealand , that assessed the ability of endoscopic evaluations and step-up treatment to prevent CD recurrence after surgery . METHODS	Levels of FC , serum levels of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , and Crohn 's disease activity index ( CDAI ) scores were measured before surgery and then at 6 , 12 , and 18 months after resection of all macroscopic Crohn 's disease . METHODS	Ileocolonoscopies were performed at 6 months after surgery in 90 patients and at 18 months after surgery in all patients . RESULTS	Levels of FC were measured in 319 samples from 135 patients . RESULTS	The median FC level decreased from 1347 g/g before surgery to 166 g/g at 6 months after surgery , but was higher in patients with disease recurrence ( based on endoscopic analysis ; Rutgeerts score , i2 ) than in patients in remission ( 275 vs 72 g/g , respectively ; P < .001 ) . RESULTS	Combined 6 - and 18-month levels of FC correlated with the presence ( r = 0.42 ; P < .001 ) and severity ( r = 0.44 ; P < .001 ) of CD recurrence , but the CRP level and CDAI score did not . RESULTS	Levels of FC greater than 100 g/g indicated endoscopic recurrence with 89 % sensitivity and 58 % specificity , and a negative predictive value ( NPV ) of 91 % ; this means that colonoscopy could have been avoided in 47 % of patients . RESULTS	Six months after surgery , FC levels less than 51 g/g in patients in endoscopic remission predicted maintenance of remission ( NPV , 79 % ) . RESULTS	In patients with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months who stepped-up treatment , FC levels decreased from 324 g/g at 6 months to 180 g/g at 12 months and 109 g/g at 18 months . CONCLUSIONS	In this analysis of data from a prospective clinical trial , FC measurement has sufficient sensitivity and NPV values to monitor for CD recurrence after intestinal resection . CONCLUSIONS	Its predictive value might be used to identify patients most likely to relapse . CONCLUSIONS	After treatment for recurrence , the FC level can be used to monitor response to treatment . CONCLUSIONS	It predicts which patients will have disease recurrence with greater accuracy than CRP level or CDAI score ."
"BACKGROUND	Beta-palmitate ( sn-2 palmitate ) mimics human milk fat , enabling easier digestion.Therefore , we hypothesized that infants consuming high beta-palmitate formula would have more frequent , softer stools and reduced crying compared to infants consuming low beta-palmitate formula . METHODS	Formula-fed infants were randomly assigned to receive either ( 1 ) formula with high beta-palmitate ( HBP , n = 21 ) or ( 2 ) regular formula with a standard vegetable oil mix ( LBP , n = 21 ) . METHODS	A matched group of breastfed infants served as a reference ( BF , n = 21 ) . METHODS	Crying and stool characteristics data were recorded by the parents for 3 days before the 6 - and 12-week visits . RESULTS	We found no significant differences in the stool frequency or consistency between the two formula groups . RESULTS	The percentage of crying infants in the LBP group was significantly higher than that in the HBP and BF groups during the evening at 6 weeks ( 88.2 % vs. 56.3 % and 55.6 % , p < 0.05 ) and during the afternoon at 12 weeks ( 91.7 % vs. 50.0 % and 40 % , p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The infants fed HBP had significantly shorter crying durations when compared with infants fed LBP formula ( 14.90 3.85 vs. 63.96 21.76 min/day , respectively ; p = 0.047 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Our study indicates that consumption of a high beta-palmitate formula affects infant crying patterns during the first weeks of life . CONCLUSIONS	Comparable to breastfeeding , it reduced crying duration and frequency , primarily during the afternoon and evening hours , thereby improving the well-being of formula-fed infants and their parents . BACKGROUND	NCT00874068.Registration date March 31 , 2009 ."
"BACKGROUND	Many bacterial pathogens causing respiratory infections in children are common residents of the respiratory tract . BACKGROUND	Insight into bacterial colonization patterns and microbiota stability at a young age might elucidate healthy or susceptible conditions for development of respiratory disease . OBJECTIVE	To study bacterial succession of the respiratory microbiota in the first 2 years of life and its relation to respiratory health characteristics . METHODS	Upper respiratory microbiota profiles of 60 healthy children at the ages of 1.5 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months were characterized by 16S-based pyrosequencing . METHODS	We determined consecutive microbiota profiles by machine-learning algorithms and validated the findings cross-sectionally in an additional cohort of 140 children per age group . RESULTS	Overall , we identified eight distinct microbiota profiles in the upper respiratory tract of healthy infants . RESULTS	Profiles could already be identified at 1.5 months of age and were associated with microbiota stability and change over the first 2 years of life . RESULTS	More stable patterns were marked by early presence and high abundance of Moraxella and Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum and were positively associated with breastfeeding in the first period of life and with lower rates of parental-reported respiratory infections in the consecutive periods . RESULTS	Less stable profiles were marked by high abundance of Haemophilus or Streptococcus . CONCLUSIONS	These findings provide novel insights into microbial succession in the respiratory tract in infancy and link early-life profiles to microbiota stability and respiratory health characteristics . CONCLUSIONS	New prospective studies should elucidate potential implications of our findings for early diagnosis and prevention of respiratory infections . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT00189020 ) ."

"OBJECTIVE	To estimate the efficacy of a probiotic yogurt compared to a pasteurised yogurt for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children . METHODS	This was a multisite , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted between September 2009 and 2012 . METHODS	The study was conducted through general practices and pharmacies in Launceston , Tasmania , Australia . METHODS	Children ( aged 1-12years ) prescribed antibiotics , were randomised to receive 200g/day of either yogurt ( probiotic ) containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) , Bifidobacterium lactis ( Bb-12 ) and Lactobacillus acidophilus ( La-5 ) or a pasteurised yogurt ( placebo ) for the same duration as their antibiotic treatment . RESULTS	Stool frequency and consistency were recorded for the duration of treatment plus 1week . RESULTS	Primary outcome was stool frequency and consistency , classified at different levels of diarrhoea severity . RESULTS	Due to the small number of cases of diarrhoea , comparisons between groups were made using Fisher 's exact analysis . RESULTS	72 children commenced and 70 children ( 36 placebo and 34 probiotic ) completed the trial . RESULTS	There were no incidents of severe diarrhoea ( stool consistency 6 , 3 stools/day for 2 consecutive days ) in the probiotic group and six in the placebo group ( Fisher 's exact p = 0.025 ) . RESULTS	There was also only one episode of minor diarrhoea ( stool consistency 5 , 2 stools/day for 2days in the probiotic group compared to 21 in the placebo group ( Fisher 's exact p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The probiotic group reported fewer adverse events ( 1 had abdominal pain , 1 vomited and 1 had headache ) than the placebo group ( 6 had abdominal pain , 4 had loss of appetite and 1 had nausea ) . CONCLUSIONS	A yogurt combination of LGG , La-5 and Bb-12 is an effective method for reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children .

"BACKGROUND	Chronic gastritis ( CG ) , a poorly understood entity , is a very common disease of the digestive tract and is difficult to cure . BACKGROUND	Chronic non-atrophic gastritis ( CNG ) is the most common type of CG . BACKGROUND	Even if treated with current standard chemotherapy , some patients will not be freed from this confusing disease . BACKGROUND	Many studies have shown traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) is more effective compared to chemotherapy in the treatment of chronic gastritis and no serious side effects have been identified . BACKGROUND	However , the studies that have been carried out were not scientifically rigorous trials . BACKGROUND	Our aim is to design a high-quality trial for a new TCM drug , the Jian-Wei-Qu-Tong Pills ( JWQTP ) , to investigate the efficacy and safety of this new drug in treating chronic non-atrophic gastritis patients with spleen and stomach qi deficiency with damp-heat stasis syndrome ( SSQDDSS ) . METHODS	This is a phase II , multicenter , parallel-group , double-blind , randomized and placebo-controlled trial . METHODS	A total of 240 participants will be assigned to a high-dose group , a low-dose group or a placebo control group with a 1:1:1 ratio at five sites . METHODS	Then , one dose ( six 1-g pills ) , with a variable ratio between real drug and dummy drug according to the intervention protocol , will be taken three times a day before each meal for 8 weeks . METHODS	The primary outcome is the eradication rate of epigastric pain . METHODS	The secondary outcome includes the changes of endoscopic examination , histopathological examination , traditional Chinese medicine symptom scores and patient-reported outcome instrument scores for chronic gastrointestinal diseases and the eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori ( HP ) . CONCLUSIONS	Many CNG patients suffer from frequent , recurrent bouts of dyspeptic symptoms . CONCLUSIONS	This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JWQTP in treating CNG with SSQDDSS in a multicenter , parallel-group , double-blind , randomized and placebo-controlled manner . CONCLUSIONS	This trial may not only provide evidence for a phase III clinical trial , but also a vision of an alternative option for CNG treatment . BACKGROUND	The registration number , ChiCTR-TRC-14004088 , was assigned by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 7 January 2014 ."
"BACKGROUND	Bread can contribute to the regulation of appetite . OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate the appetite ratings and postprandial glucose , insulin , and gastrointestinal hormone responses related to hunger and satiety after the intake of a cereal-based bread . METHODS	A randomized , controlled crossover trial was conducted in 30 healthy adults ( 17 men and 13 women ) aged 19-32 y with body mass index of 19.2-28 .5 . METHODS	Each volunteer consumed the cereal-based bread and the control bread 2 times , with a 1-wk wash-out period , over a total of 4 sessions . METHODS	The cereal-based bread contained a variety of cereal flours ( wheat , oat , and spelt ) and consisted of 22 % dried fruits ( figs , apricots , raisins , and prunes ) . METHODS	It was also enriched with both fiber ( 7 % from wheat cross-linked maltodextrins and pea ) and protein ( 10-11 % from wheat gluten and hydrolyzed wheat proteins ) . METHODS	The control bread consisted of white bread with margarine and jam to control for energy density , fat , and sugar content . METHODS	We measured appetite ratings using standardized visual analogue scales and glucose , insulin , and gastrointestinal hormone responses over a postprandial time of 4 h after the ingestion of each bread . METHODS	Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare the areas under the curve ( AUCs ) for different variables . RESULTS	Consuming the cereal-based bread decreased prospective consumption more than consumption of the control bread ( -5.3 0.6 m min and -4.4 0.6 m min , respectively ; P = 0.02 ) and increased satiety more ( 6.2 0.7 m min and 5.2 0.6 m min , respectively ; P = 0.04 ) , although subsequent ad libitum energy intake 4 h later did not differ . RESULTS	Postprandial blood glucose , insulin , ghrelin , glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide AUCs were lower after the ingestion of the cereal-based bread , whereas the pancreatic polypeptide AUC was higher than with the control bread ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of the cereal-based bread contributed to appetite control by reducing hunger and enhancing satiety . CONCLUSIONS	In addition , consumption of this bread improved glycemic , insulinemic , and gastrointestinal hormone responses in healthy adults . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02090049 ."
"BACKGROUND	Efficient fat digestion requires fat processing within the stomach and fat sensing in the intestine . BACKGROUND	Both processes also control gastric emptying and gastrointestinal secretions . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to visualize the influence of the intragastric stability of fat emulsions on their dynamics of gastric processing and structuring and to assess the effect this has on gastrointestinal motor and secretory functions . METHODS	Eighteen healthy subjects with normal body mass index ( BMI ) were studied on 4 separate occasions in a double-blind , randomized , crossover design . METHODS	Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data of the gastrointestinal tract and blood triglycerides were recorded before and for 240 min after the consumption of the following 4 different fat emulsions : lipid emulsion 1 ( LE1 ; acid stable , 0.33 m ) , lipid emulsion 2 ( LE2 ; acid stable , 52 m ) , lipid emulsion 3 ( LE3 ; acid unstable , solid fat , 0.32 m ) , and lipid emulsion 4 ( LE4 ; acid unstable , liquid fat , 0.38 m ) . RESULTS	Intragastric emulsion instability was associated with a change in gastric emptying . RESULTS	Acid-unstable emulsions exhibited biphasic and faster emptying profiles than did the 2 acid-stable emulsions ( P 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	When combined with solid fat ( LE3 ) , different dynamics of postprandial gallbladder volume were induced ( P 0.001 ) . RESULTS	For acid-stable emulsions , a reduction of droplet size by 2 orders of magnitude [ LE1 ( 0.33 m ) compared with LE2 ( 52 m ) ] delayed gastric emptying by 38 min . RESULTS	Although acid-stable ( LE1 and LE2 ) and redispersible ( LE4 ) emulsions caused a constant increase in blood triglycerides , no increase was detectable for LE3 ( P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	For LE3 , MRI confirmed the generation of large fat particles during gastric processing , which emptied into and progressed through the small intestine . CONCLUSIONS	MRI allows the detailed characterization of the in vivo fate of lipid emulsions . CONCLUSIONS	The acute effects of lipid emulsions on gastric emptying , gallbladder volume , and triglyceride absorption are dependent on microstructural changes undergone during consumption . CONCLUSIONS	Gastric peristalsis and secretion were effective at redispersing pools of liquid fat in the stomach . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01253005 ."
"BACKGROUND	Daikenchuto ( DKT ) has widely been used to improve abdominal symptoms by being expected to accelerate bowel motility . BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of DKT for prevention of ileus and associated gastrointestinal symptoms after total gastrectomy . METHODS	Two hundred and forty-five gastric cancer patients who underwent total gastrectomy were enrolled . METHODS	Patients received either DKT ( 15.0 g/d ) or matching placebo from postoperative days 1 to 12 . METHODS	Primary end points were time to first flatus , time to first bowel movement ( BM ) , and frequency of BM . METHODS	Secondary end points included quality of life , C-reactive protein level , symptoms indicative of a severe gastrointestinal disorder , and incidence of postoperative ileus . RESULTS	A total of 195 patients ( DKT , n = 96 ; placebo , n = 99 ) were included in the per-protocol set analysis . RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of patient background characteristics . RESULTS	Median time to first BM was shorter in the DKT group than in the placebo group ( 94.7 hours vs 113.9 hours ; p = 0.051 ) . RESULTS	In patients with high medication adherence , median time to first BM was significantly shorter in the DKT group than in the placebo group ( 93.8 hours vs 115.1 hours ; p = 0.014 ) . RESULTS	Significantly fewer patients in the DKT group had 2 symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction than those in the placebo group on postoperative day 12 ( p = 0.026 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Administration of DKT during the immediate postoperative period after total gastrectomy appears to promote early recovery of postoperative bowel function ."
"BACKGROUND	Long-term macrolide treatment has proven benefit in inflammatory airways diseases , but whether it leads to changes in the composition of respiratory microbiota is unknown . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether long-term , low-dose erythromycin treatment changes the composition of respiratory microbiota in people with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis . METHODS	Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of sputum samples from participants in the BLESS trial , a 12-month , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of twice-daily erythromycin ethylsuccinate ( 400 mg ) in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and at least two infective exacerbations in the preceding year . METHODS	The primary outcome was within-patient change in respiratory microbiota composition ( assessed by Bray-Curtis index ) between baseline and week 48 , comparing erythromycin with placebo . METHODS	The BLESS trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry , number ACTRN12608000460303 . RESULTS	The BLESS trial took place between Oct 15 , 2008 , and Dec 14 , 2011 . RESULTS	Paired sputum samples were available from 86 randomly assigned patients , 42 in the placebo group and 44 in the erythromycin group . RESULTS	The change in microbiota composition between baseline and week 48 was significantly greater with erythromycin than with placebo ( median Bray-Curtis score 052 [ IQR 014-078 ] vs 068 [ 046-093 ] ; median difference 016 , 95 % CI 001-033 ; p = 003 ) . RESULTS	In patients with baseline airway infection dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , erythromycin did not change microbiota composition significantly . RESULTS	In those with infection dominated by organisms other than P. aeruginosa , erythromycin caused a significant change in microbiota composition ( p = 003 [ by analysis of similarity ] ) , representing a reduced relative abundance of Haemophilus influenzae ( 353 % [ 55-916 ] vs 67 % [ 08-748 ] ; median difference 126 % , 95 % CI 04-283 ; p = 004 ; interaction p = 002 ) and an increased relative abundance of P aeruginosa ( 002 % [ 000-033 ] vs 013 % [ 001-3958 ] ; median difference 66 % , 95 % CI 01-371 ; p = 0002 ; interaction p = 045 ) . RESULTS	Compared with placebo , erythromycin reduced the rate of pulmonary exacerbations over the 48 weeks of the study in patients with P. aeruginosa-dominated infection ( median 1 [ IQR 0-3 ] vs 3 [ 2-5 ] ; median difference -2 , 95 % CI -4 to -1 ; p = 001 ) , but not in those without P. aeruginosa-dominated infection ( 1 [ 0-2 ] vs 1 [ 0-3 ] ; median difference 0 , -1 to 0 ; p = 041 ; interaction p = 004 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term erythromycin treatment changes the composition of respiratory microbiota in patients with bronchiectasis . CONCLUSIONS	In patients without P. aeruginosa airway infection , erythromycin did not significantly reduce exacerbations and promoted displacement of H. influenzae by more macrolide-tolerant pathogens including P. aeruginosa . CONCLUSIONS	These findings argue for a cautious approach to chronic macrolide use in patients without P. aeruginosa airway infection . BACKGROUND	Mater Adult Respiratory Research Trust Fund ."
"OBJECTIVE	National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ( NSABP ) R-04 was a randomized controlled trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable stage II-III rectal cancer . OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection ( APR ) would have a poorer quality of life than those who underwent sphincter-sparing surgery ( SSS ) . METHODS	To obtain patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) we administered two symptom scales at baseline and 1 year postoperatively : the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal ( FACT-C ) and the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer module for patients with Colorectal Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-CR38 ) . METHODS	Scoring was stratified by nonrandomly assigned definitive surgery ( APR vs SSS ) . METHODS	Analyses controlled for baseline scores and stratification factors : age , sex , stage , intended surgery , and randomly assigned chemoradiotherapy . RESULTS	Of 1,608 randomly assigned patients , 987 had data for planned analyses ; 62 % underwent SSS ; 38 % underwent APR. . RESULTS	FACT-C total and subscale scores were not statistically different by surgery at 1 year . RESULTS	For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 functional scales , APR patients reported worse body image ( 70.3 vs 77.0 , P = 0.0005 ) at 1 year than did SSS patients . RESULTS	Males undergoing APR reported worse sexual enjoyment ( 43.7 vs 54.7 , P = 0.02 ) at 1 year than did those undergoing SSS . RESULTS	For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 symptom scale scores , APR patients reported worse micturition symptoms than the SSS group at 1 year ( 26.9 vs 21.5 , P = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	SSS patients reported worse gastrointestinal tract symptoms than did the APR patients ( 18.9 vs 15.2 , P < 0.0001 ) , as well as weight loss ( 10.1 vs 6.0 , P = 0.002 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Symptoms and functional problems were detected at 1 year by EORTC QLQ-CR38 , reflecting different symptom profiles in patients who underwent APR than those who underwent SSS . CONCLUSIONS	Information from these PROs may be useful in counseling patients anticipating surgery for rectal cancer ."
"BACKGROUND	Among patients without cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and low 10-year CVD risk , the risks of gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes associated with aspirin use outweigh any potential atheroprotective benefit . BACKGROUND	According to the guidelines on primary prevention of CVD , aspirin use is considered appropriate only in patients with 10-year CVD risk 6 % and inappropriate in patients with 10-year CVD risk < 6 % . OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to examine the frequency and practice-level variation in inappropriate aspirin use for primary prevention in a large U.S. nationwide registry . METHODS	Within the National Cardiovascular Disease Registry 's Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry , we assessed 68,808 unique patients receiving aspirin for primary prevention from 119 U.S. practices . METHODS	The frequency of inappropriate aspirin use was determined for primary prevention ( aspirin use in those with 10-year CVD risk < 6 % ) . METHODS	Using hierarchical regression models , the extent of practice-level variation using the median rate ratio ( MRR ) was assessed . RESULTS	Inappropriate aspirin use frequency was 11.6 % ( 7,972 of 68,808 ) in the overall cohort . RESULTS	There was significant practice-level variation in inappropriate use ( range 0 % to 71.8 % ; median 10.1 % ; interquartile range 6.4 % ) for practices ; adjusted MRR was 1.63 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.47 to 1.77 ) . RESULTS	Results remained consistent after excluding 21,052 women age 65 years ( inappropriate aspirin use 15.2 % ; median practice-level inappropriate aspirin use 13.8 % ; interquartile range 8.2 % ; adjusted MRR 1.61 [ 95 % CI : 1.46 to 1.75 ] ) and after excluding patients with diabetes ( inappropriate aspirin use 13.9 % ; median practice-level inappropriate aspirin use 12.4 % ; interquartile range 7.6 % ; adjusted MRR 1.55 [ 95 % CI : 1.41 to 1.67 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	More than 1 in 10 patients in this national registry were receiving inappropriate aspirin therapy for primary prevention , with significant practice-level variations . CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that there are important opportunities to improve evidence-based aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD ."
"BACKGROUND	Gastroparesis is common in surgical patients and frequently leads to the need for enteral tube feeding . BACKGROUND	Nasoenteral feeding tubes are usually placed endoscopically by gastroenterologists , but this procedure is relatively cumbersome for patients and labor-intensive for hospital staff . BACKGROUND	Electromagnetic ( EM ) guided bedside placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes by nurses may reduce patient discomfort , workload and costs , but randomized studies are lacking , especially in surgical patients . BACKGROUND	We hypothesize that EM guided bedside placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes is at least as effective as endoscopic placement in surgical patients , at lower costs . METHODS	The CORE trial is an investigator-initiated , parallel-group , pragmatic , multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial . METHODS	A total of 154 patients admitted to gastrointestinal surgical wards in five hospitals , requiring nasoenteral feeding , will be randomly allocated to undergo EM guided or endoscopic nasoenteral feeding tube placement . METHODS	Primary outcome is reinsertion of the feeding tube , defined as the insertion of an endoscope or tube in the nose/mouth and esophagus for ( re ) placement of the feeding tube ( e.g. after failed initial placement or dislodgement or blockage of the tube ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes , costs and tube ( placement ) related complications . CONCLUSIONS	The CORE trial is designed to generate evidence on the effectiveness of EM guided placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes in surgical patients and the impact on costs as compared to endoscopic placement . CONCLUSIONS	The trial potentially offers a strong argument for wider implementation of this technique as method of choice for placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes .

"OBJECTIVE	To perform an analysis and comparative study of the clinical data for patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome ( HRS ) who received treatment with terlipressin using high-or low-dose regimens . METHODS	A total of 56 patients with cirrhosis and type 1 HRS who presented for treatment to the Wuhan Medical Treatment Center and Taizhou Central Hospital between March 2010 and October 2012 were enrolled in the study . METHODS	The patients were randomly assigned to the terlipressin treatment groups for receipt of the high-dose regimen ( 1 mg/6 -8 h ; n = 27 ) or low-dose regimen ( 1 mg/12 h ; n = 29 ) . METHODS	All patients were assessed for 24-hour urine volume , serum blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and creatinine ( Cr ) levels , therapeutic effect and prognosis , and adverse reactions . METHODS	Measurements were made before and after the treatment , and on post-treatment days 3 , 7 and 14 . METHODS	Inter-group differences were assessed by statistical analyses . RESULTS	The high-dose group showed an increase in 24-hour urine volumes from post-treatment day 3 ( 1112 262 ml ) to day 7 ( 1938 312 ml ) , and the volumes on both days were significantly better than those of the low-dose group ( day 3:986 162 ml and day 7:1760 300 ml , t = 1.500 , 1.830 , P = 0.038 , 0.041 ) . RESULTS	The high-dose group also showed a significantly better decreases in serum BUN levels ( 35.1 8.6 to 30.2 6.3 mmol/L vs.low-dose group : 43.2 10.9 to 35.1 7.6 mmol/L , t = 3.200 , 5.901 , P = 0.043 , 0.047 ) and in serum Cr values ( 219.0 35.1 to 128.2 41.6 vs.low-dose group : 230.3 82.1 to 151.5 38.7 , t = 2.997 , 5.765 , P = 0.036 , 0.046 ) . RESULTS	On post-treatment day 14 the 24-hour urine volume of patients in the high-dose group decreased ( to 720 + / -136 ml ) , but the difference from that of the low-dose group was not significant ( vs. 620 164 ml , t = 1.855 , P = 0.069 ) . RESULTS	The serum BUN level increased in the high-dose group ( to 54.4 15.0 mmol/L ) , which was statistically different from that in the low-dose group ( vs .57.7 17.3 mmol/L , t = 5.166 , P = 0.022 ) ; the same trend was seen for the serum Cr value ( 397.8 127.4 mumol/L vs. 480.3 179.8 mumol/L , t = 5.638 , P = 0.047 ) . RESULTS	No statistically significant differences were observed for the groups in regard to significant efficiency , efficiency or 2-week survival rate ( x2 = 2.314 , 1.767 , 0.678 , P = 0.128 , 0.128 , 0.410 respectively ) , but the total efficiency was significantly different between the two groups ( x = 5.793 , P = 0.016 ) . RESULTS	In addition , no serious adverse reactions ( including precordial pain , myocardial infarction or intestinal necrosis ) were observed in either group . CONCLUSIONS	Terlipressin therapy at both high and low dosages can lead to significant beneficial effects within as little as 3 days after the treatment ; however , the high-dose appears to produce a better lasting efficacy ( at day 14 after the treatment ) . CONCLUSIONS	The difference in doses does not appear to markedly affect significant efficiency , efficiency , nor the 2-week survival rate ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of oral Lactobacillus reuteri ( L reuteri ) first on the incidence and severity of Necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC ) and second on sepsis . METHODS	Prospective randomised controlled study . METHODS	Tertiary neonatal intensive care unit . METHODS	Preterm infants with a gestational age of 32 weeks and a birth weight of 1500 g were included ( n = 400 ) . METHODS	Infants in the first group were given 100 million CFU/day ( 5 drops ) of lyophilised L reuteri ( DSM 17938 ) mixed in breast milk or formula , starting from first feeding until discharge . METHODS	Participants in the control group were given a placebo . METHODS	To determine and compare the frequency of NEC and/or death after 7 days , frequency of proven sepsis , rates of feeding intolerance and duration of hospital stay . RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of frequency of NEC stage 2 ( 4 % vs 5 % ; p = 0.63 ) or overall NEC or mortality rates ( 10 % vs 13.5 % ; p = 0.27 ) . RESULTS	Frequency of proven sepsis was significantly lower in the probiotic group compared to the control group ( 6.5 % vs 12.5 % ; p = 0.041 ) . RESULTS	A significant difference was also observed with regard to rates of feeding intolerance ( 28 % vs 39.5 % ; p = 0.015 ) and duration of hospital stay ( 38 ( 10-131 ) vs 46 ( 10-180 ) days ; p = 0.022 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Our results show that oral L reuteri does not seem to affect the overall rates of NEC and/or death in preterm infants followed up in the neonatal intensive care unit , and significant reductions were observed in the frequency of proven sepsis , rates of feeding intolerance and duration of hospital stay . BACKGROUND	NCT01531179 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the pain on injection of propofol via different combinations of fentanyl , sufentanil or remifentanil in gastrointestinal endoscopy . METHODS	Total 439 patients were randomly allocated into 6 groups . METHODS	Propofol & fentanil ( PF ) group received 1 g/kg fentanyl , propofol & sufentanil ( PS ) group received 0.1 g/kg sufentanil and propofol & remifentanyl ( PR ) group received 1 g/kg remifentanyl prior to administration of 1-2 mg/kg of propofol . METHODS	The propofol & half-fentanil ( Pf ) group , propofol & half-sufentanil ( Ps ) group and propofol & half-remifentanyl ( Pr ) group were given 0.5 g/kg fentanyl , 0.05 g/kg sufentanil and 0.5 g/kg remifentanyl , respectively and later administrated 1-2 mg/kg propofol . METHODS	All patients were monitored for the blood pressure ( MAP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , and oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) . METHODS	Additionally , the pain intensity was assessed using a 4-point verbal rating scale ( VRS ) by professional doctors . RESULTS	The incidence of pain due to propofol injection in Ps group ( 33.8 % ) was significantly lower than other 5 groups . RESULTS	The heart rate ( HR ) and mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) were maintained within the normal limits in all six groups and there was no hypotension or bradycardia encountered during the study period . CONCLUSIONS	Propofol and sufentanil group was the most suitable program for painless gastroscopy ."
"BACKGROUND	Current evidence suggests that many patients with self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity ( NCGS ) retain gastrointestinal symptoms on a gluten-free diet ( GFD ) but continue to restrict gluten as they report ` feeling better ' . OBJECTIVE	To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those with NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal symptoms . METHODS	Twenty-two subjects ( 24-62 years , five male ) with irritable bowel syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically controlled on a GFD , undertook a double-blind cross-over study . METHODS	Participants randomly received one of three dietary challenges for 3 days , followed by a minimum 3-day washout before crossing over to the next diet . METHODS	Challenge gluten-free food was supplemented with gluten ( 16 g/day ) , whey ( 16 g/day ) or not supplemented ( placebo ) . METHODS	End-points included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State Trait Personality Inventory ( STPI ) , cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal symptoms . RESULTS	Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state depression scores compared to placebo [ M = 2.03 , 95 % CI ( 0.55-3 .51 ) , P = 0.010 ] but not whey [ M = 1.48 , 95 % CI ( -0.14 to 3.10 ) , P = 0.07 ] . RESULTS	No differences were found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI trait measures . RESULTS	No difference in cortisol secretion was identified between challenges . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal symptoms were induced similarly across all dietary challenges . CONCLUSIONS	Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of depression with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition . CONCLUSIONS	Gluten-specific induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not identified . CONCLUSIONS	Such findings might explain why patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity feel better on a gluten-free diet despite the continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms ."
"BACKGROUND	Ciclosporin is approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis ( AD ) in dogs and has been shown to be safe and effective . BACKGROUND	Placebo-controlled studies suggest that oclacitinib is a safe and effective alternative therapy . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oclacitinib , in comparison to ciclosporin , for the control of AD in a blinded , randomized clinical trial , incorporating a noninferiority test at day 28 . METHODS	A total of 226 client-owned dogs with a history of AD from eight sites were enrolled . METHODS	Enrolled animals were randomized to receive oral oclacitinib ( 0.4-0 .6 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days , then once daily ) or oral ciclosporin ( 3.2-6 .6 mg/kg once daily ) for 12 weeks . METHODS	Owners assessed pruritus using an enhanced visual analog scale ( VAS ) , and veterinarians assessed dermatitis using the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index ( CADESI ) -02 . RESULTS	On days 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 56 and 84 , the percentage reduction from baseline for owner-assessed pruritus changed from 25.6 to 61.0 % in the oclacitinib group compared with 6.5 to 61.5 % in the ciclosporin group ; differences were significant at all time points up to day 28 . RESULTS	On day 56 , ciclosporin-treated dogs showed a similar decrease in pruritus to oclacitinib-treated dogs . RESULTS	On day 14 , the percentage reduction from baseline CADESI-02 was significantly greater in the oclacitinib group ( 58.7 % ) than in the ciclosporin group ( 43.0 % ) . RESULTS	Three times as many adverse events attributed to gastrointestinal signs were reported in the ciclosporin group compared with the oclacitinib group . CONCLUSIONS	In this study of treatment for canine AD , oclacitinib had a faster onset of action and a lower frequency of gastrointestinal side effects compared with ciclosporin ."
"OBJECTIVE	Sleep and ongoing cycling of sleep states are required for neurosensory processing , learning , and brain plasticity . OBJECTIVE	Many aspects of neonatal intensive care environments such as handling for routine and invasive procedures , bright lighting , and noise can create stress , disrupt behavior , and interfere with sleep in prematurely born infants . OBJECTIVE	The study empirically investigated whether a 30-minute observation of infant sleep states and behavior could differentiate an intervention to promote sleep in premature infants with feeding difficulties relative to conventional care ( standard positioning , standard crib mattress [ SP ] ) . OBJECTIVE	We included an intervention to determine the ability of the method to discriminate treatments and generate a benchmark for future improvements . OBJECTIVE	The intervention , a conformational positioner ( CP ) , is contoured around the infant to provide customized containment and boundaries . OBJECTIVE	To more fully verify the 30-minute observational sleep results , standard polysomnography was conducted simultaneously and sleep outcomes for the 2 modalities were compared . METHODS	In a randomized crossover clinical trial , 25 infants , 31.5 0.6 weeks ' gestational age and 38.4 0.6 weeks at the study , with gastrointestinal conditions or general feeding difficulties used each intervention during an overnight neonatal intensive care unit sleep study . METHODS	Infant sleep states and behaviors were observed during two 30-minute periods -- that is , on the positioner and mattress -- using the naturalistic observation of newborn behavior . METHODS	Two certified developmental care nurses assessed sleep state , self-regulatory , and stress behaviors during 2-minute intervals and summed over 30 minutes . METHODS	Sleep characteristics from standard polysomnography were measured at the time of behavior observations . RESULTS	Infants on CP spent significantly less time in alert , active awake , or crying states by observation compared with SP . RESULTS	Surgical subjects spent more time awake , active awake , or crying and displayed a higher number of behavior state changes than the nonsurgical infants . RESULTS	The percentage of time in observed deep sleep and quiet sleep was correlated with both percentage sleep efficiency ( r = 0.78 ) and fewer state shifts per hour ( r = -0.65 ) from electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . RESULTS	Sleep efficiency by EEG was greater on CP versus SP . CONCLUSIONS	The CP enabled sleep compared with the standard mattress ( SP ) over 30-minute observation periods . CONCLUSIONS	Sleep status from behavioral observation was verified by standard EEG-based sleep techniques . CONCLUSIONS	Behavioral observation of sleep states may be a useful strategy for measuring the effectiveness of strategies to facilitate sleep in premature infants . CONCLUSIONS	Surgical subjects may benefit from additional interventions to promote sleep ."
"OBJECTIVE	Combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) is now the global standard for HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women at all CD4 cell counts . OBJECTIVE	We compared the efficacy and safety of an efavirenz versus lopinavir/ritonavir regimen for HIV-infected pregnant women initiating ART in rural Uganda . METHODS	Randomized clinical trial . METHODS	We performed a planned secondary analysis comparing viral load suppression ( HIV-1 RNA 400 copies/ml ) , safety , and HIV transmission to infants in a trial designed to test the hypothesis that lopinavir/ritonavir versus efavirenz-based ART would reduce placental malaria ( PROMOTE , ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00993031 ) . METHODS	HIV-infected , ART-naive pregnant women at 12-28 weeks gestation and any CD4 cell count were randomized . METHODS	ART was provided and participants were counseled to breastfeed for 1 year postpartum . RESULTS	The median age of the 389 study participants was 29 years ; median CD4 cell count was 370 cells/l . RESULTS	At delivery , virologic suppression was 97.6 % in the efavirenz arm and 86.0 % in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	At 48 weeks postpartum , 91.0 % of women on efavirenz and 88.4 % on lopinavir/ritonavir had viral suppression ( P = 0.49 ) . RESULTS	Grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal adverse events were higher among women on lopinavir/ritonavir versus efavirenz . RESULTS	Only two infants acquired HIV ( both in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm ) , and HIV-free infant survival was similar between study arms : 92.9 % ( lopinavir/ritonavir ) versus 97.2 % ( efavirenz ) ( P = 0.10 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Virologic suppression at delivery was higher with an efavirenz versus lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen . CONCLUSIONS	However , women in both arms achieved high levels of virologic suppression through 1 year postpartum and the risk of transmission to infants was low ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy and safety of sedation with dexmedetomidine in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . METHODS	Patients with ASA physical status I-II undergoing elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomly allocated to receive dexmedetomidine or midazolam for conscious sedation . METHODS	Continuous peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , heart rate , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , Ramsay Sedation Scale ( RSS ) and numeric rating scale pain scores were recorded before , during and after the procedure . METHODS	Patients completed a post-procedure satisfaction questionnaire . RESULTS	Patients in the midazolam group ( n = 30 ) experienced a significant decrease in MAP during sedation compared with pre-sedation values . RESULTS	Patients in the dexmedetomidine group ( n = 30 ) had significantly higher SpO2 and RSS scores during sedation than those in the midazolam group . RESULTS	Overall satisfaction was higher in the dexmedetomidine group than the midazolam group . RESULTS	There were no clinically significant complications in either group . CONCLUSIONS	Dexmedetomidine has a good safety profile and is an effective sedative for use in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ."
"BACKGROUND	Catecholamines and inflammatory mediators , with elevated levels after brain death , are associated with reduced function and survival of transplanted organs . BACKGROUND	Enteral nutrition reduces tissue damage and may benefit organs . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of immunomodulating enteral nutrition in organ donors . METHODS	Prospective , randomized , open-label study . METHODS	Intensive care unit . METHODS	Thirty-six brain-dead organ donors . METHODS	Donors were randomized to receive enteral nutrition containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , antioxidants , and glutamine or standard care ( fasting ) . METHODS	Donors received hormonal replacement therapy of corticosteroid , levothyroxine , dextrose , and insulin . METHODS	Gastrointestinal assimilation ( measured by 13 carbon-labeled uracil breath analysis ) , quantity of organs recovered , resting energy expenditure , urine level of urea nitrogen , and serum levels of albumin , prealbumin , interleukin 6 , tumor necrosis factor - , and C-reactive protein were evaluated . RESULTS	Thirteen patients ( 36 % ) assimilated 13C-labeled uracil . RESULTS	Resting energy expenditure was significantly higher than predicted between 10 and 14 hours after baseline in 33 donors ( P = .007 ) . RESULTS	Other measures were not conclusively different between fed and fasting groups . RESULTS	No adverse events occurred that were related to the enteral feeding . CONCLUSIONS	About 30 % of donors metabolized 13C-labeled uracil , although no difference in oxidation rate was found between fasting and fed donors . CONCLUSIONS	Corticosteroid administration lowers plasma levels of interleukin 6 and most likely contributes to greater than predicted resting energy expenditure . CONCLUSIONS	Thus energy needs may not be met during fasting if hormones are given . CONCLUSIONS	Consequences of this possible energy deficit warrant further study ."
"OBJECTIVE	To identify micronutrient deficiencies in patients with functional bowel diseases ( FBD ) and to reveal their correction with functional foods and probiotics . METHODS	The health status was evaluated in 90 patients aged 18 to 67 years with FBD . METHODS	All the patients were randomized into 3 groups according to the treatment regimen . METHODS	Group 1 took Amaltea goat 's milk 200 ml/day during basic therapy ; Group 2 received multispecies and multistrain RioFlora Balance probiotics in addition to the above components ; Group 3 ( a control group ) had traditional basic dietary therapy . METHODS	All the groups continued their treatment for 14 days . RESULTS	The performed examinations have demonstrated that diet-based treatment fortified with goat 's milk and multispecies probiotics makes it possible to more promptly achieve remission and to level off clinical manifestations than in the control group . RESULTS	The patients using multispecies probiotics versus the control group showed a reduction in fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and a considerable improvement in quality of life . CONCLUSIONS	FBD lacks a specific clinical picture and may be masked as lactase deficiency , which commonly leads to noticeable limitations in patients ' diet and favors the development of vitamin deficiency . CONCLUSIONS	Of particular concern is the development of vitamin D deficiency in young patients , which may result in the early development of osteoporosis in the future . CONCLUSIONS	To specify the composition of enzymes in the patients gives grounds to refuse restricted diets , and the dietary addition of functional foods ( goat 's milk fortified with vitamins and minerals ) , particularly in combination with multistrain probiotics , produces a pronounced clinical effect and eliminates fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies ."
"BACKGROUND	Tivozanib hydrochloride ( tivozanib ) is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of all 3 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors with antitumor activity additive to 5-fluorouracil in preclinical models . BACKGROUND	This study was conducted to determine maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) , dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) , pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) , and antitumor activity of escalating doses of tivozanib with a modified ( m ) FOLFOX-6 ( leucovorin , 5-fluorouracil [ 5-FU ] , and 85 mg/kg ( 2 ) oxaliplatin ) regimen in patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumors . METHODS	Tivozanib was administered orally once daily for 21 days in 28-day cycles , with mFOLFOX-6 administered every 14 days . METHODS	Patients were allowed to continue tivozanib after discontinuation of mFOLFOX-6 . RESULTS	Thirty patients were assigned to tivozanib 0.5 mg ( n = 9 ) , 1.0 mg ( n = 3 ) , or 1.5 mg ( n = 18 ) with mFOLFOX-6 . RESULTS	Patients received a median of 5.2 ( range , 0.03-26 .9 ) months of tivozanib . RESULTS	DLTs were observed in 2 patients : Grade 3/4 transaminase level increases with tivozanib 0.5 mg , and Grade 3 dizziness with tivozanib 1.5 mg . RESULTS	Other Grade 3/4 adverse events included hypertension ( n = 8 ) , fatigue ( n = 8 ) , and neutropenia ( n = 6 ) . RESULTS	MTD for tivozanib with mFOLFOX-6 was confirmed as 1.5 mg . RESULTS	No PK interactions between tivozanib and mFOLFOX-6 were observed . RESULTS	One patient had an ongoing clinical complete response , 10 had a partial response , and 11 obtained prolonged stable disease . CONCLUSIONS	Tivozanib and mFOLFOX-6 is feasible and appears to be safe . CONCLUSIONS	The recommended dose for tivozanib with mFOLFOX-6 is 1.5 mg/d . CONCLUSIONS	Observed clinical activity merits further exploration in gastrointestinal tumors ."
"OBJECTIVE	To study the effect of probiotic consumption on the faecal microbiota during and after antibiotic exposure . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study with a two species probiotic combination [ Lactobacillus acidophilus ( L. acidophilus ) ATCC 700396 and Bifidobacterium lactis ( B. lactis ) ATCC SD5220 ] on healthy adults during and after antibiotic treatment ( amoxicillin 875 and 125 mg clavulanate ) . METHODS	The dominant faecal microbiota was studied by real time-polymerase chain reaction to determine if this probiotic preparation could facilitate restoring the microbiota to its pre-antibiotic state and influence the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance . METHODS	Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by questionnaire and Bristol stool scale . RESULTS	Subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at day 8 ( end of antibiotic treatment period ) vs those on placebo . RESULTS	Furthermore , subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at Day 15 ( end of probiotic treatment ) vs those on placebo . RESULTS	Lactobacillus counts remained stable in the probiotic group over the course of the study , while Clostridium XIV group was higher at the end of the study and closer to baseline levels ; this in contrast to the placebo group . RESULTS	Beta-lactam resistance in creased after antibiotic exposure and was not different between both treatment groups . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal symptoms were generally mild and did not differ between the treatment groups , which correlates with the generally small changes in the microbiota . CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of the probiotic combination mainly leads to an increase in the faecal levels of the species included in the preparation ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare the impacts of electroacu puncture ( EA ) and moxibustion ( Mox ) on the prima ry gastrointestinal symptoms and the expressions of colonic mucosa-associated neuropeptide substance P ( SP ) and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) in patients with either diarrhea-predominant or constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D and IBS-C , respectively ) . METHODS	Eighty-five IBS patients were randomly allocated to the EA and Mox groups . METHODS	Zusanli ( ST 36 ) and Shangjuxu ( ST 37 ) were selected as acupoints for electroacupuncture or warm moxibustion treatment once a day for 14 consecutive days . METHODS	Before and after the treatment sessions , a Visual Analog Pain Scale and the Bristol Stool Form Scale were used to evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms . METHODS	There were four dropout cases , leaving 81 participants ( 41 with IBS-D and 40 with IBS-C ) who volunteered to undergo colonoscopy before and after the treatment sessions . METHODS	During colonoscopy , sigmoid mucosa were collected to detect SP and VIP expression using immunohistochemistry assay . RESULTS	Both EA and Mox treatments were effective at relieving abdominal pain in IBS-D and IBS-C patients . RESULTS	However , Mox was more effective at reducing diarrhea in IBS-D patients , whereas EA was more effective at improving constipation in IBS-C patients . RESULTS	EA and Mox treatments both down-regulated the abnormally increased SP and VIP expression in the colonic mucosa , with no significant difference shown between the two treatments . CONCLUSIONS	Both EA and Mox treatments are effective at ameliorating gastrointestinal symptoms by reducing SP and VIP expression in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients ."
"BACKGROUND	The importance of interactions between the host and gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) is becoming increasingly apparent . BACKGROUND	Probiotics offer a potential new treatment for IBS , but current results are conflicting , largely as a result of poorly designed trials and nonstandardisation of outcome measures . OBJECTIVE	To assess the efficacy of a liquid , multi-strain probiotic ( Symprove ) in IBS . METHODS	A single-centre , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with symptomatic IBS . METHODS	Patients received 12 weeks of treatment with the probiotic or placebo ( 1 mL/kg/day ) . METHODS	The primary efficacy measure was the difference in change in the IBS symptom severity score ( IBS-SSS ) between probiotic vs. placebo at week 12 . METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included change in the IBS quality of life ( IBS-QOL ) score and change in the IBS-SSS symptom component scores . RESULTS	A total of 186 patients were randomised and 152 patients completed the study . RESULTS	The mean change in IBS-SSS was -63.3 probiotic vs. -28.3 placebo . RESULTS	The mean difference in the IBS-SSS was statistically significant [ -35.0 ( 95 % CI ; -62.03 , -7.87 ) ; P = 0.01 ] . RESULTS	There was no significant improvement in the IBS-QOL . RESULTS	No serious adverse events were reported . CONCLUSIONS	The multi-strain probiotic was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall symptom severity in patients with IBS , and was well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest this probiotic confers benefit in IBS and deserves further investigation ( ISRCTN identifier : 77512412 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Oropharyngeal dysphagia ( OD ) is a major gastrointestinal motility disorder that causes severe nutritional and respiratory complications in elderly and neurological patients . BACKGROUND	In an earlier study , we found that stimulation of pharyngeal sensory neurons by capsaicinoids acting on transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1 ) improved the swallow response of dysphagic patients . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to explore the effect of piperine , a dual TRPV1/TRPA1 agonist , on the swallow response of dysphagic patients . METHODS	A videofluoroscopic study was performed to assess the signs of impaired safety and efficacy of swallow and the swallow response of 40 dysphagic patients while swallowing one series of nectar control boluses and two series of nectar boluses supplemented with piperine . METHODS	Patients were randomized into two groups : one group received 150 M piperine and the other group received 1 mM . RESULTS	Piperine improved the safety of swallow by : ( a ) reducing the prevalence of unsafe swallows by -34.48 % ( P = 0.004 ) at 150 M and -57.19 % ( P < 0.001 ) at 1 mM , and the severity score of the penetration-aspiration scale from 3.25 0.51 to 1.85 0.27 ( P = 0.003 , 1 mM ) ; and ( b ) shortening the time to laryngeal vestibule closure from 0.366 0.024 to 0.270 0.022 s with 150 M piperine ( P < 0.001 ) and from 0.380 0.032 to 0.306 0.028 s with 1 mM piperine ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Supplementing the alimentary bolus with piperine speeds swallow response and strongly improves safety of swallow in patients with OD , with a maximal therapeutic effect at 1 mM . CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that activation of TRPV1/A1 in oropharyngeal sensory neurons is a very promising neurostimulation strategy for dysphagic patients ."
"BACKGROUND	Classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves four ports while most novel ` single port ' technique only requires one incision on the abdominal wall . BACKGROUND	This technique is thought to decrease surgical trauma and improve cosmesis although there are reports pointing out that classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy is also feasible in terms of cosmesis . OBJECTIVE	In this study we tried to determine if there are certain advantages in quality of life after single port surgery which would justify its utilization instead of classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy . METHODS	This is aprospective randomized study which enrolled 30 patients randomized either into classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy or single port surgery . METHODS	The primary endpoint was patient satisfaction after surgery . METHODS	This was assessed with short form 36 and gastrointestinal quality of life index ( first preoperatively and then 3months postoperatively ) and avisual analogue scale on the first and seventh days . RESULTS	There was not astatistically significant difference between groups in the emotional role , social functions , mental health , vitality and general health subscales of short form 36 . RESULTS	At the end of 12 weeks , both groups demonstrated increases in the gastrointestinal and social subscales of the gastrointestinal quality of life index . RESULTS	There was not astatistically significant difference between groups when the visual analogue scale scores on first and seventh days were compared . CONCLUSIONS	The equal length of hospitalization , patient quality of life and pain perception and the longer operative times , high likelihood of incisional hernia and surgical site infection call into question the utilization of single port surgery , as it does not seem to confer an advantage over classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy ."
"BACKGROUND	Dietary fiber ( DF ) intake in American children is suboptimal , increasing the risk of GI distress and contributing to poor diet quality . BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to determine the effect of introducing two high-fiber snacks per day on gastrointestinal function as well as nutrient and food group intake in healthy children ages 7-11years old . METHODS	This study was a randomized controlled prospective intervention study of children 7-11years of age ( n = 81 ) attending a rural Midwestern elementary school . METHODS	Children were randomized by classroom to consume two high-fiber snacks per day ( total of 10-12g DF ) or their usual snacks for 8weeks . METHODS	Participants completed two 24-hour dietary recalls and a questionnaire about their GI health at baseline , mid-intervention ( week 4 ) , and post-intervention . METHODS	Dietary data was entered into NDSR 2011 and t-tests utilized to assess changes . METHODS	Analyses were completed in SAS 9.2 . RESULTS	Children consumed at least half their snack 94 % of the time when a snack was chosen ( 89 % of time ) . RESULTS	Participants in both the intervention and control group had healthy scores on the GI health questionnaire at all time points . RESULTS	The intervention group increased DF ( P = 0.0138 ) and whole grain ( WG ) intake ( P = 0.0010 ) at mid-intervention but after the intervention returned to their baseline DF intake ( P = 0.2205 ) and decreased their WG intake ( P = 0.0420 ) compared to baseline . RESULTS	Eating high-fiber snacks increased DF intake by 2.5 g per day ( 21 % increase ) , suggesting displacement of other fiber-rich foods . CONCLUSIONS	Study results indicate that children accept high-fiber foods , thus making these high-fiber foods and snacks consistently available will increase DF intake ."
"BACKGROUND	Amino-acid-based formulas ( AAFs ) are recommended for children with cow 's milk protein allergy ( CMPA ) failing to respond to extensively hydrolyzed formulas ( eHFs ) . OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to assess the tolerance/hypoallergenicity and efficacy of a thickened AAF ( TAAF ) in these infants . METHODS	This multicenter , double-blind , randomized controlled trial ( NCT01940068 ) compared 3-month feeding with a pectin-based TAAF ( Novalac ( ) , United Pharmaceuticals , Paris , France ) and a commercially available `` reference '' AAF ( RAAF ; Neocate ( ) , Nutricia , Germany ) in infants aged < 18 months with CMPA and persistent allergy symptoms with eHF feeding . METHODS	Reported here are the results of an interim analysis after 1 month of feeding . RESULTS	Of the 86 infants randomized , CMPA with eHF intolerance was confirmed in 75 infants ; all of them tolerated the allocated AAFs . RESULTS	The major allergic symptom disappeared within 1 month in 61.9 and 51.5 % and regurgitations disappeared in 66.7 and 42.3 % of infants who received TAAF and RAAF , respectively . RESULTS	Infants had significantly more normal stools ( soft or formed consistency ) with the TAAF ( 90.5 vs. 66.7 % ; p = 0.011 ) . RESULTS	From baseline , daily family life significantly improved with both AAFs : crying time decreased by 97.3 ( p < 0.001 ) and 28.6 min ( p = 0.014 ) and sleeping time increased by 64.6 ( p = 0.009 ) and 29.0 min with TAAF and RAAF , respectively . RESULTS	At day 30 , weight and body mass index z-score gains were 0.1 and 0.2 with TAAF and 0.2 and 0.0 with RAAF . CONCLUSIONS	Both AAFs were well tolerated by infants with CMPA and eHF intolerance and ensured appropriate growth , with the TAAF providing additional comfort ."
"OBJECTIVE	Evidence from animal and in vitro models suggest a role of probiotic bacteria in improving glycaemic control and delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes . OBJECTIVE	However , the evidence from controlled trials in humans is limited . OBJECTIVE	The objective was to determine if the probiotic bacteria L. acidophilus La5 and B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 , supplemented in a whole food ( yoghurt ) or isolated ( capsules ) form , can improve biomarkers of glycaemic control . METHODS	Following a 3-week washout period , 156 overweight men and women over 55 years ( mean age : 67 8 years ; mean body mass index ( 31 4 kg/m ( 2 ) ) were randomized to a 6-week double-blinded parallel study . METHODS	The four intervention groups were : ( A ) probiotic yoghurt plus probiotic capsules ; ( B ) probiotic yoghurt plus placebo capsules ; ( C ) control milk plus probiotic capsules ; and ( D ) control milk plus placebo capsules . METHODS	Outcome measurements , including fasting glucose , insulin , glycated haemoglobin and Homoeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , were performed at baseline and week 6 . RESULTS	Relative to the milk-control group , probiotic yoghurt resulted in a significantly higher HOMA-IR ( 0.32 0.15 , P = 0.038 ) , but did not have a significant effect on the other three measures of glycaemic control ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Relative to placebo capsules , probiotic capsules resulted in a significantly higher fasting glucose ( 0.15 0.07 mmol/l , P = 0.037 ) , with no significant effect on the other three measures of glycaemic control ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Further analyses did not identify other variables as contributing to these adverse findings . CONCLUSIONS	Data from this study does not support the hypothesis that L. acidophilus La5 and B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 , either in isolated form or as part of a whole food , benefit short-term glycaemic control . CONCLUSIONS	Indeed , there is weak data for an adverse effect of these strains on glucose homoeostasis ."
"BACKGROUND	It is important to understand whether eating eggs , which are a major source of dietary choline , results in increased exposure to trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO ) , which is purported to be a risk factor for developing heart disease . OBJECTIVE	We determined whether humans eating eggs generate TMAO and , if so , whether there is an associated increase in a marker for inflammation [ ie , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) ] or increased oxidation of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . METHODS	In a longitudinal , double-blind , randomized dietary intervention , 6 volunteers were fed breakfast doses of 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , or 6 egg yolks . METHODS	Diets were otherwise controlled on the day before and day of each egg dose with a standardized low-choline menu . METHODS	Plasma TMAO at timed intervals ( immediately before and 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 24 h after each dose ) , 24-h urine TMAO , predose and 24-h postdose serum hsCRP , and plasma oxidized LDL were measured . METHODS	Volunteers received all 5 doses with each dose separated by > 2-wk washout periods . RESULTS	The consumption of eggs was associated with increased plasma and urine TMAO concentrations ( P < 0.01 ) , with 14 % of the total choline in eggs having been converted to TMAO . RESULTS	There was considerable variation between individuals in the TMAO response . RESULTS	There was no difference in hsCRP or oxidized LDL concentrations after egg doses . CONCLUSIONS	The consumption of 2 eggs results in an increased formation of TMAO . CONCLUSIONS	Choline is an essential nutrient that is required for normal human liver and muscle functions and important for normal fetal development . CONCLUSIONS	Additional study is needed to both confirm the association between TMAO and atherosclerosis and identify factors , microbiota and genetic , that influence the generation of TMAO before policy and medical recommendations are made that suggest reduced dietary choline intake ."
"OBJECTIVE	Obesity has been associated with changes in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota . OBJECTIVE	Modulation of the microbiota by antibiotics also alters bile acid and glucose metabolism in mice . OBJECTIVE	Hence , we hypothesized that short term administration of oral antibiotics in humans would affect fecal microbiota composition and subsequently bile acid and glucose metabolism . METHODS	In this single blinded randomized controlled trial , 20 male obese subjects with metabolic syndrome were randomized to 7 days of amoxicillin 500 mg t.i.d. or 7 days of vancomycin 500 mg t.i.d. METHODS	At baseline and after 1 week of therapy , fecal microbiota composition ( Human Intestinal Tract Chip phylogenetic microarray ) , fecal and plasma bile acid concentrations as well as insulin sensitivity ( hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp using [ 6,6 - ( 2 ) H2 ] - glucose tracer ) were measured . RESULTS	Vancomycin reduced fecal microbial diversity with a decrease of gram-positive bacteria ( mainly Firmicutes ) and a compensatory increase in gram-negative bacteria ( mainly Proteobacteria ) . RESULTS	Concomitantly , vancomycin decreased fecal secondary bile acids with a simultaneous postprandial increase in primary bile acids in plasma ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Moreover , changes in fecal bile acid concentrations were predominantly associated with altered Firmicutes . RESULTS	Finally , administration of vancomycin decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Amoxicillin did not affect any of these parameters . CONCLUSIONS	Oral administration of vancomycin significantly impacts host physiology by decreasing intestinal microbiota diversity , bile acid dehydroxylation and peripheral insulin sensitivity in subjects with metabolic syndrome . CONCLUSIONS	These data show that intestinal microbiota , particularly of the Firmicutes phylum contributes to bile acid and glucose metabolism in humans . CONCLUSIONS	This trial is registered at the Dutch Trial Register ( NTR2566 ) ."
"OBJECTIVE	Patients with diarrhoea during enteral nutrition ( EN ) have been shown to have low faecal bifidobacteria concentrations . OBJECTIVE	Oligofructose/inulin selectively stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria in healthy humans . OBJECTIVE	This study investigates the effect of additional oligofructose/inulin on the gastrointestinal microbiota , short-chain fatty acids ( SCFA ) and faecal output in patients receiving EN . METHODS	Adult patients in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) who were starting EN with a formula containing fibre were randomised to receive 7g/d of additional oligofructose/inulin or an identically packaged placebo ( maltodextrin ) . METHODS	A fresh faecal sample was collected at baseline and following at least 7 days of supplementation . METHODS	Faecal microbiota were analysed using fluorescent in-situ hybridisation and faecal output was monitored daily . RESULTS	Twenty-two patients ( mean age 71 years ) completed at least 7 days of intervention ( mean 12 days ) . RESULTS	At the end of the intervention , there were no significant differences in the concentrations of bifidobacteria between the groups , after adjusting for baseline values ( oligofructose/inulin 6.9 +1.4 , placebo 7.8 +1.3 log10cells/g dry faeces , P > 0.05 ) , but there were significantly lower concentrations of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ( 7.0 +1.0 vs. 8.4 +1.3 log10cells/g , P = 0.01 ) and Bacteroides-Prevotella ( 9.1 +1.0 vs. 9.9 +0.9 log10cells/g , P = 0.05 ) in patients receiving additional oligofructose/inulin . RESULTS	There were no differences in faecal concentrations of any SCFA , secretory IgA , daily faecal score or incidence of diarrhoea between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	Additional oligofructose/inulin did not increase faecal bifidobacteria in critically ill patients receiving EN , although it did result in lower concentrations of F.prausnitzii and Bacteroides-Prevotella . CONCLUSIONS	This trial is registered at http://controlled-trials.com . CONCLUSIONS	Identifier : ISRCTN06446184 ."
"BACKGROUND	Incontinence-associated dermatitis ( IAD ) is a potentially serious skin injury that can lead to pressure ulcers ( PUs ) . BACKGROUND	Multiple studies have indicated the need for evidence to find the most effective skin care protocol to reduce the incidence and severity of IAD in critically ill patients . OBJECTIVE	To compare the incidence and severity of IAD in two groups on a progressive care unit ( PCU ) using a defined skin care protocol : cleaning with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer , then applying a skin protectant/barrier . OBJECTIVE	The control group received the skin care protocol every 12 hours and the interventional group received the protocol every 6 hours ; both groups also received it as needed . METHODS	A 9-month randomized prospective study was conducted on 99 patients ( N = 55 in the intervention group and N = 44 in the control group ) who were incontinent of urine , stool , or both , or had a fecal diversion device or urinary catheter for more than 2 days . RESULTS	The dermatitis score in the intervention group on discharge was significantly less ( 7.1 % ; P 0.001 ) in the moderate IAD group than in the control group ( 10.9 % ) . RESULTS	The dermatitis score means and P values of each group were compared using a paired t test . CONCLUSIONS	The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion , followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol , undertaken at two different frequencies . CONCLUSIONS	Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group ( receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n. ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Few safe and effective dietary supplements are available to promote weight loss . BACKGROUND	We evaluated the safety and efficacy of glucomannan , a water-soluble fiber supplement , for achieving weight loss in overweight and moderately obese individuals consuming self-selected diets . METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to take 1.33 grams of glucomannan or identically looking placebo capsules with 236.6 mL ( 8 ounces ) of water one hour before breakfast , lunch , and dinner for 8 weeks . METHODS	The primary efficacy outcome was change in body weight after 8 weeks . METHODS	Other efficacy outcomes were changes in body composition , hunger/fullness , and lipid and glucose concentrations . METHODS	Safety outcomes included gastrointestinal symptoms/tolerance and serum liver enzymes and creatinine levels . RESULTS	A total of 53 participants ( 18-65 years of age ; BMI 25-35kg / m ) were enrolled and randomized . RESULTS	The two groups did not differ with respect to baseline characteristics and compliance with the study supplement . RESULTS	At 8 weeks , there was no significant difference between the glucomannan and placebo groups in amount of weight loss ( -.40 .06 and -.43 .07 , resp . ) RESULTS	or other efficacy outcomes or in any of the safety outcomes . CONCLUSIONS	Glucomannan supplements administered over 8 weeks were well tolerated but did not promote weight loss or significantly alter body composition , hunger/fullness , or lipid and glucose parameters . CONCLUSIONS	This trial is registered with NCT00613600 ."
"BACKGROUND	Intragastric creaming and droplet size of fat emulsions may affect intragastric behavior and gastrointestinal and satiety responses . OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypotheses that gastrointestinal physiologic responses and satiety will be increased by an increase in intragastric stability and by a decrease in fat droplet size of a fat emulsion . METHODS	This was a double-blind , randomized crossover study in 11 healthy persons [ 8 men and 3 women , aged 24 1 y ; body mass index ( in kg/m ( 2 ) ) : 24.4 0.9 ] who consumed meals containing 300-g 20 % oil and water emulsion ( 2220 kJ ) with 1 ) larger , 6-m mean droplet size ( Coarse treatment ) expected to cream in the stomach ; 2 ) larger , 6-m mean droplet size with 0.5 % locust bean gum ( LBG ; Coarse + LBG treatment ) to prevent creaming ; or 3 ) smaller , 0.4-m mean droplet size with LBG ( Fine + LBG treatment ) . METHODS	The participants were imaged hourly by using MRI and food intake was assessed by using a meal that participants consumed ad libitum . RESULTS	The Coarse + LBG treatment ( preventing creaming in the stomach ) slowed gastric emptying , resulting in 12 % higher gastric volume over time ( P < 0.001 ) , increased small bowel water content ( SBWC ) by 11 % ( P < 0.01 ) , slowed appearance of the ( 13 ) C label in the breath by 17 % ( P < 0.01 ) , and reduced food intake by 9 % ( P < 0.05 ) compared with the Coarse treatment . RESULTS	The Fine + LBG treatment ( smaller droplet size ) slowed gastric emptying , resulting in 18 % higher gastric volume ( P < 0.001 ) , increased SBWC content by 15 % ( P < 0.01 ) , and significantly reduced food intake by 11 % ( P < 0.05 , equivalent to an average of 411 kJ less energy consumed ) compared with the Coarse + LBG treatment . RESULTS	These high-fat meals stimulated substantial increases in SBWC , which increased to a peak at 4 h at 568 mL ( range : 150-854 mL ; P < 0.01 ) for the Fine + LBG treatment . CONCLUSIONS	Manipulating intragastric stability and fat emulsion droplet size can influence human gastrointestinal physiology and food intake ."
"BACKGROUND	Dyschezia is a defecatory disorder that places a heavy burden on a patient 's quality of life . BACKGROUND	Biofeedback is the recommended treatment in most cases . OBJECTIVE	The objective of our study was to test whether a CO2-releasing suppository for patients with dyschezia could be effective in improving biofeedback training results . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , multicenter , placebo-controlled study was conducted in patients ( 18-75 years of age ) with dyschezia defined according to the modified Rome III criteria . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to either a CO2-releasing suppository or placebo suppository once per day for 21 days . METHODS	This was a multicenter trial . METHODS	A total of 122 patients were randomly assigned ( 62 intervention group and 60 placebo group ) . METHODS	The primary end point was the change from day 0 to day 21 in intensity of symptoms on the basis of a self-assessed dyschezia using a visual analog scale ( range , 0-100 ) . METHODS	Analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principles . RESULTS	A greater reduction from baseline to day 21 in symptom visual analog scale score was observed in the intervention group ( -41.3 mm ) than in the control group ( -22.3 mm ) . RESULTS	Some secondary efficacy parameters improved more in the intervention group , including the percentage of patients who improved 50 % , symptom intensity over 21 days , stool stains on underwear or pads , and need to practice manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation at day 21 . RESULTS	At day 21 , rectal sensitivity in the intervention group ( 31.4 mL ) was lower than in the control group ( 39.1 mL ) . CONCLUSIONS	There was a lower number of patients recruited than planned by the protocol . CONCLUSIONS	The sponsor stopped the trial before the inclusion of 306 participants , with no intermediate analysis . CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the main analysis conducted on the full analysis set population could have led to a statistical bias . CONCLUSIONS	The results of this multicenter trial demonstrate the added benefits of a CO2-releasing suppository in patients with dyschezia who were treated by anorectal biofeedback training ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of central venous blood oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) and venous-arterial PCO2 ( P ( cv-a ) CO2 ) guided fluid therapy on tissue perfusion , gastrointestinal function recovering and outcome of the patients who undergoing open gastrointestinal surgery . METHODS	Forty patients undergoing open gastrointestinal surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups ( n = 20 each ) : ScvO2 guided fluid therapy ( group S ) and P ( cv-a ) CO2 guided fluid therapy ( group P ) . METHODS	All the patients were infused 10 ml/kg lactated Ringer 's ( LR ) solution before anesthesia induction , they were all also given a continuous lactated Ringer 's ( LR ) solution 's infusion at the speed of 2 mlkg ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) during the operation . METHODS	While , 6 % HES 130/0 .4 ( free flex 6 % HES 130/0 .4 , Fresenius Kabi ) infusion was different between the 2 groups , when the patients of group S 's central venous blood oxygen saturation < 75 % or venous-arterial PCO2 in the patients of P group 6 mm Hg , then infused 6 % HES 130/0 .4 . METHODS	Arterial and central venous blood gas analyses were performed every 20 minutes after skin incision , measure the venous and arterial lactate value , and record the anal exhaust time after surgery , postoperative complications and mortality in 28 days . RESULTS	Compared with group S , the arterial lactate value in T4 ( after operation began 80 min ) were significantly decreased in group P ( P = 0.013 ) , and venous lactate value in T5 ( after operation began 100 min ) were also lower ( P = 0.044 ) , other lactate value were not different ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The anal exhaust time was not different between the two groups ( P = 0.673 ) . RESULTS	All the patients were survival , and there were no obvious postoperative complications . CONCLUSIONS	Compared to group S , there was a transient improvement in tissue perfusion in group P , but there were no difference in complications and mortality ."
"BACKGROUND	To assess the temporal patterns of late gastrointestinal ( GI ) and genitourinary ( GU ) radiotherapy toxicity and resolution rates in a randomised controlled trial ( All-Ireland Cooperative Oncology Research Group 97-01 ) assessing duration of neo-adjuvant ( NA ) hormone therapy for localised prostate cancer . METHODS	Node negative patients with > 1 of : PSA > 20 ng/mL , Gleason score 7 , and stage T3 or more , were included . METHODS	Follow-up , including toxicity assessment , was three-monthly in the early stages and yearly thereafter . RESULTS	Median follow-up from the end of RT was 6.8 years . RESULTS	In the interval between 90 days following the end of RT and the last toxicity assessment , GI and GU toxicity ( any grade ) was found in 50 % and 51 % of 240 and 241 patients , respectively . RESULTS	For those who did develop toxicity , the median time from end of RT until the first development of any grade GI or GU toxicity was 1.2 years and 1.6 years , respectively , whilst median time to final resolution was 1.6 years and 2.2 years , respectively . RESULTS	Grade 2 ( G2 ) or greater GI and GU toxicity occurred in 29 ( 12.1 % ) and 40 ( 16.6 % ) patients , respectively . RESULTS	The proportion with unresolved G2 + GI and GU toxicity was 89 % and 79 % , respectively , in year 1 , 69 % and 65 % in year 2 , 59 % and 52 % in year 3 and 27 % and 32 % in year 5 . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term toxicities continue to occur many years after NA hormone therapy and RT. . CONCLUSIONS	The rate of occurrence does not appear to reduce within the time frame during which our patients were followed . CONCLUSIONS	The percentage of patients suffering from G2 + toxicity at any time is however low . CONCLUSIONS	Resolution of these toxicities continues for the duration of the follow-up ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated Lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . BACKGROUND	Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in AD symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain L. salivarius LS01 . BACKGROUND	S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function . METHODS	A prospective , controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum could improve the activity of L. salivarius LS01 administered at high doses to adults with AD . METHODS	Twenty-five patients were included into the study : 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation , whereas 12 represented the placebo group . METHODS	Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration . METHODS	Fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus and clostridia . RESULTS	A significant improvement in SCORAD index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment , whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients . RESULTS	A slight decrease in fecal S. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients . CONCLUSIONS	Data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for L. salivarius LS01 in the treatment of AD . CONCLUSIONS	The addition of tara gum and S. thermophilus ST10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain , in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects .

"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of ingesting a caffeinated carbohydrate gel ( CC ) 10 minutes prior on 2000-m rowing performance compared with a carbohydrate-only placebo gel ( CP ) . METHODS	A counterbalanced , single-blind , crossover study design was employed ( N = 13 ) . METHODS	All participants completed 1 familiarization trial followed by 2 experimental rowing time trials . METHODS	The experimental trials were performed 10 min after ingesting CP ( 21.6 g of carbohydrate , 0 mg caffeine ) or CC ( 21.6 g carbohydrate , 100 mg caffeine ) , and heart rate ( HR ) , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production , minute ventilation ( VE ) , respiratory-exchange ratio ( RER ) , rating of perceived exertion ( RPE ) , gastrointestinal discomfort ( GI ) , and thirst perception ( Thirst ) were recorded every 200 m. Blood lactate [ La - ] was recorded immediately before and after exercise . RESULTS	A pairedsamples t test identified a significant improvement in 2000-m performance of 5.23.9 s ( 1.1 % 1.7 % ; P = .034 ) . RESULTS	Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant treatment effect for HR ( 1778 vs 1779 beats/min , P = .817 ) , VO2 ( 46.16.5 vs 46.66.2 mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) , P = .590 ) , VE ( 121.814.7 vs 124.815.7 L/min , P = .490 ) , RPE , GI , or Thirst for CP and CC , respectively . RESULTS	Paired-samples t tests revealed no treatment effect for postexercise [ La - ] between CP and CC ( 11.722.69 vs 12.263.13 mmol/L , P = .534 ) . CONCLUSIONS	A relatively low dose of caffeine ( 1.30.1 mg/kg body mass ) in an isotonic carbohydrate gel ingested only 10 min before performance improved 2000-m rowing time by 5.27.8 s ( 1.1 % 1.7 % ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Isoperistaltic stapled side-to-side anastomosis ( SSSA ) , which is a modified technique from conventional antiperistaltic SSSA , has the benefits of antiperistaltic SSSA but requires less intestinal mobility . BACKGROUND	The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate short-term outcomes of isoperistaltic SSSA comparing them with antiperistaltic SSSA during colon cancer surgery . METHODS	We conducted a randomized controlled trial of patients with colon cancer who underwent elective curative resection and had enough intestinal mobility at anastomosis . METHODS	The primary outcome was the presence of anastomotic failure , including leakage , hemorrhage , and stenosis . RESULTS	Between July 2012 and January 2014 , forty patients were enrolled ( 20 patients in each group ) . RESULTS	The study was suspended on detecting excess morbidity in the isoperistaltic SSSA group . RESULTS	No significant differences were observed in all preoperative backgrounds between the two groups . RESULTS	Anastomotic leakage was seen in two patients in the isoperistaltic SSSA group , compared with none in the antiperistaltic SSSA group , although the difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.487 ) . RESULTS	One patient in the antiperistaltic SSSA group had anastomotic stenosis , which improved conservatively , compared with none in the isoperistaltic SSSA group ( P = 1.000 ) . RESULTS	No anastomotic hemorrhage was seen in either group . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the median postoperative hospital stay ( P = 0.313 ) . CONCLUSIONS	This study did not show any short-term advantage or disadvantage of isoperistaltic SSSA compared with that of antiperistaltic SSSA . CONCLUSIONS	However , considering that anastomotic leakage occurred only in the isoperistaltic SSSA group , additional modifications are recommended to perform safe isoperistaltic SSSA for colon surgery ."
"BACKGROUND	Due to the steady increase of substance-dependent pregnant women the neonatal abstinence syndrome has become an increasingly important issue in neonatology . BACKGROUND	The present study investigates site-specific differences of detailed symptoms and treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome within the context of an international multicenter clinical trial . METHODS	Site specific neonatal data analyses from a prospective randomized , double-blind , double-dummy clinical trial ( MOTHER study ) was performed . METHODS	A standardized NAS rating and treatment protocol was applied , while non-pharmacological care of NAS symptoms differed across the sites . RESULTS	Urban US neonates exhibited most neurological symptoms ( p < 0.001 ) while in Europe autonomous , respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were found significantly more often compared to urban and/or rural US ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Methadone produced significantly greater scores than buprenorphine in neurological , behavioural and respiratory symptoms regardless of the sites ( ps < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	NAS treatment rates in all site clusters were similar for methadone-exposed neonates , while in Europe significantly more buprenorphine-exposed neonates were treated ( p = 0.001 ) than in US site clusters . RESULTS	Urban US neonates had significantly higher NAS scores ( p < 0.01 ) compared to rural US and European neonates , and needed significantly higher morphine doses ( p < 0.05 ) with longer treatment duration . RESULTS	Birth weight , length and head circumference did not differ significantly among the site clusters , but APGAR scores were significantly higher in European ( p < 0.01 ) neonates . CONCLUSIONS	In addition to intrauterine medication exposure other aspects such as different addiction severity of the mothers , different treatment modalities including rooming-in as well as the frequency of NAS ratings may be influencing the course of NAS ."
"BACKGROUND	Interactions between the microbial flora of the intestine and the human host play a critical role inmaintaining intestinal health and in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders such as antibiotic associated diarrhea , Clostridium difficile infection , and inflammatory bowel disease . BACKGROUND	Prebiotics can confer health benefits by beneficial effects on the intestinal microbiome , whereas antibiotics can disrupt the microbiome leading to diarrhea andother side effects . OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of the prebiotic , polysaccharopeptide from Trametes versicolor , to those of the antibiotic , amoxicillin , on the human gut microbiome METHODS	Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to receive PSP , amoxicillin , or no treatment ( control ) . METHODS	Stool specimens were analyzed using bTEFAP microbial ecology methods on seven occasions over 8 weeks from each participant in the active treatment groups and on three occasions for the controls . RESULTS	Twenty-two of 24 participants completed the protocol . RESULTS	PSP led to clear and consistent microbiome changes consistent with its activity as a prebiotic . RESULTS	Despite the diversity of the human microbiome we noted strong microbiome clustering among subjects . RESULTS	Baseline microbiomes tended to remain stable and to overshadow the treatment effects.Amoxicillin treatment caused substantial microbiome changes most notably an increase in Escherichia/Shigella . RESULTS	Antibiotic associated changes persisted to the end of the study , 42 days after antibiotic therapy ended . CONCLUSIONS	The microbiomes of healthy individuals show substantial diversity but remain stable over time.The antibiotic amoxicillin alters the microbiome and recovery from this disruption can take several weeks . CONCLUSIONS	PSP from T. versicolor acts as a prebiotic to modulate human intestinal microbiome composition ."
"OBJECTIVE	Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is difficult to treat , and standard therapy does not always induce remission . OBJECTIVE	Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) is an alternative approach that induced remission in small series of patients with active UC . OBJECTIVE	We investigated its safety and efficacy in a placebo-controlled randomized trial . METHODS	We performed a parallel study of patients with active UC without infectious diarrhea . METHODS	Participants were examined by flexible sigmoidoscopy when the study began and then were randomly assigned to groups that received FMT ( 50 mL , via enema , from healthy anonymous donors ; n = 38 ) or placebo ( 50 mL water enema ; n = 37 ) once weekly for 6 weeks . METHODS	Patients , clinicians , and investigators were blinded to the groups . METHODS	The primary outcome was remission of UC , defined as a Mayo score 2 with an endoscopic Mayo score of 0 , at week 7 . METHODS	Patients provided stool samples when the study began and during each week of FMT for microbiome analysis . METHODS	The trial was stopped early for futility by the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee , but all patients already enrolled in the trial were allowed to complete the study . RESULTS	Seventy patients completed the trial ( 3 dropped out from the placebo group and 2 from the FMT group ) . RESULTS	Nine patients who received FMT ( 24 % ) and 2 who received placebo ( 5 % ) were in remission at 7 weeks ( a statistically significant difference in risk of 17 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 2 % -33 % ) . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in adverse events between groups . RESULTS	Seven of the 9 patients in remission after FMT received fecal material from a single donor . RESULTS	Three of the 4 patients with UC 1 year entered remission , compared with 6 of 34 of those with UC > 1 year ( P = .04 , Fisher 's exact test ) . RESULTS	Stool from patients receiving FMT had greater microbial diversity , compared with baseline , than that of patients given the placebo ( P = .02 , Mann-Whitney U test ) . CONCLUSIONS	FMT induces remission in a significantly greater percentage of patients with active UC than placebo , with no difference in adverse events . CONCLUSIONS	Fecal donor and time of UC appear to affect outcomes . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov Number : NCT01545908 ."
"OBJECTIVE	ASP9831 is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor developed to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) ; it showed potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in preclinical studies . OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ASP9831 in patients with NASH . METHODS	In a phase 1 trial , we determined the optimal therapeutic window of ASP9831 in healthy volunteers and evaluated 2 doses ( 50 and 100 mg ) in patients with NASH . METHODS	Based on the positive outcomes of the phase 1 study , we performed a phase 2 trial to compare the biochemical effects of ASP9831 vs placebo . METHODS	Patients with NASH were assigned randomly to groups given either 50 mg ( n = 33 ) or 100 mg ( n = 33 ) ASP9831 twice daily , or placebo ( n = 30 ) , for 12 weeks . METHODS	The primary end point was the mean percentage change , from baseline to the end of ASP9831 administration , in serum level of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ; secondary outcomes included changes in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) levels , ratio of AST : ALT , and various biomarkers of NASH . RESULTS	After 12 weeks of administration , there was no significant change in mean serum levels of ALT ( P = .42 ) or AST ( P = .20 ) or other biomarkers in any group , and no significant differences were observed among groups . RESULTS	Most adverse events were mild ; gastrointestinal disorders occurred more frequently in the ASP9831 groups than the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	Despite a relevant mechanism of action , ASP9831 did not significantly alter the biochemical markers of NASH , compared with placebo , in a clinical trial . CONCLUSIONS	This highlights the difficulties of developing therapeutics for NASH and the need for more extensive preclinical testing of mechanisms of potential drug candidates .

"BACKGROUND	Advancing age is linked to a decrease in beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium spp . BACKGROUND	and reduced aspects of innate immune function . OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether daily consumption of a probiotic [ Bacillus coagulans GBI-30 , 6086 ( BC30 ) ; GanedenBC ( 30 ) ] could improve immune function and gut function in men and women aged 65-80 y , using a double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover design . METHODS	Thirty-six volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either a placebo ( microcrystalline cellulose ) or the probiotic BC30 ( 1 10 ( 9 ) colony-forming units/capsule ) . METHODS	Volunteers consumed 1 treatment capsule per day for 28 d , followed by a 21-d washout period before switching to the other treatment . METHODS	Blood and fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of each treatment period . METHODS	Fecal samples were used to enumerate bacterial groups and concentrations of calprotectin . METHODS	Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were extracted from whole blood to assess natural killer cell activity and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - stimulated cytokine production . METHODS	C-reactive protein concentrations were measured in plasma . RESULTS	Consumption of BC30 significantly increased populations of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii by 0.1 log10 cells/mL more than during consumption of the placebo ( P = 0.03 ) , whereas populations of Bacillus spp . RESULTS	increased significantly by 0.5 log10 cells/mL from baseline in volunteers who consumed BC30 ( P = 0.007 ) . RESULTS	LPS-stimulated PBMCs showed a 0.2 ng/mL increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 28 d after consumption of BC30 ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas the placebo did not affect IL-10 , and no overall difference was found in the effect of the treatments . CONCLUSIONS	Daily consumption of BC30 by adults aged 65-80 y can increase beneficial groups of bacteria in the human gut and potentially increase production of anti-inflammatory cytokines . CONCLUSIONS	This study shows the potential benefits of a probiotic to improve dysbiosis via modulation of the microbiota in older persons ."

"BACKGROUND	The ICON7 trial previously reported improved progression-free survival in women with ovarian cancer with the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy , with the greatest effect in patients at high risk of disease progression . BACKGROUND	We report the final overall survival results of the trial . METHODS	ICON7 was an international , phase 3 , open-label , randomised trial undertaken at 263 centres in 11 countries across Europe , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . METHODS	Eligible adult women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer that was either high-risk early-stage disease ( International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [ FIGO ] stage I-IIa , grade 3 or clear cell histology ) or more advanced disease ( FIGO stage IIb-IV ) , with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 , were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to standard chemotherapy ( six 3-weekly cycles of intravenous carboplatin [ AUC 5 or 6 ] and paclitaxel 175 mg/m ( 2 ) of body surface area ) or the same chemotherapy regimen plus bevacizumab 75 mg per kg bodyweight intravenously every 3 weeks , given concurrently and continued with up to 12 further 3-weekly cycles of maintenance therapy . METHODS	Randomisation was done by a minimisation algorithm stratified by FIGO stage , residual disease , interval between surgery and chemotherapy , and Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup group . METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ; the study was also powered to detect a difference in overall survival . METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat . METHODS	This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial , number ISRCTN91273375 . RESULTS	Between Dec 18 , 2006 , and Feb 16 , 2009 , 1528 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy ( n = 764 ) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab ( n = 764 ) . RESULTS	Median follow-up at the end of the trial on March 31 , 2013 , was 489 months ( IQR 266-562 ) , at which point 714 patients had died ( 352 in the chemotherapy group and 362 in the bevacizumab group ) . RESULTS	Our results showed evidence of non-proportional hazards , so we used the difference in restricted mean survival time as the primary estimate of effect . RESULTS	No overall survival benefit of bevacizumab was recorded ( restricted mean survival time 446 months [ 95 % CI 432-459 ] in the standard chemotherapy group vs 455 months [ 442-467 ] in the bevacizumab group ; log-rank p = 085 ) . RESULTS	In an exploratory analysis of a predefined subgroup of 502 patients with poor prognosis disease , 332 ( 66 % ) died ( 174 in the standard chemotherapy group and 158 in the bevacizumab group ) , and a significant difference in overall survival was noted between women who received bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and those who received chemotherapy alone ( restricted mean survival time 345 months [ 95 % CI 320-370 ] with standard chemotherapy vs 393 months [ 370-417 ] with bevacizumab ; log-rank p = 003 ) . RESULTS	However , in non-high-risk patients , the restricted mean survival time did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups ( 497 months [ 95 % CI 483-511 ] ) in the standard chemotherapy group vs 484 months [ 470-499 ] in the bevacizumab group ; p = 020 ) . RESULTS	An updated analysis of progression-free survival showed no difference between treatment groups . RESULTS	During extended follow-up , one further treatment-related grade 3 event ( gastrointestinal fistula in a bevacizumab-treated patient ) , three grade 2 treatment-related events ( cardiac failure , sarcoidosis , and foot fracture , all in bevacizumab-treated patients ) , and one grade 1 treatment-related event ( vaginal haemorrhage , in a patient treated with standard chemotherapy ) were reported . CONCLUSIONS	Bevacizumab , added to platinum-based chemotherapy , did not increase overall survival in the study population as a whole . CONCLUSIONS	However , an overall survival benefit was recorded in poor-prognosis patients , which is concordant with the progression-free survival results from ICON7 and GOG-218 , and provides further evidence towards the optimum use of bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian cancer .

RESULTS	No significant changes over time in the UA levels in both groups ( LSSC : P = 0.056 , LC : P = 0.205 ) . CONCLUSIONS	LSSC is associated with increased oxidative stress compared with LC . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to confirm these results ."
"BACKGROUND	We evaluated week-on/week-off axitinib dosing plus chemotherapy in patients with gastrointestinal tumours , including tumour thymidine uptake by fluorine-18 3 ' - deoxy-3 ' - fluorothymidine positron emission tomography ( ( 18 ) FLT-PET ) . METHODS	During a lead-in period , patients received twice daily ( b.i.d. ) axitinib 7 mg ( n = 3 ) or 10 mg ( n = 18 ) for 7 days followed by a 7-day dosing interruption ; serial ( 18 ) FLT-PET scans were performed before day 1 and on days 7 , 10 , and 14 . METHODS	Axitinib plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX was then administered in 2-week cycles ; axitinib was interrupted on day 10 of each cycle for 7 days . RESULTS	The maximum tolerated dose of axitinib was 10 mg b.i.d. , in a week-on/week-off schedule , combined with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX . RESULTS	Common all-causality grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia ( 38 % ) , hypertension ( 33 % ) , and fatigue ( 29 % ) . RESULTS	Of 21 patients , 2 ( 10 % ) had a partial response and 12 ( 57 % ) had stable disease . RESULTS	Following 7 days of continuous axitinib dosing , tumour ( 18 ) FLT uptake decreased -49 % from baseline and recovered to -28 % and -17 % from baseline , respectively , after 3 and 7 days of axitinib interruption . CONCLUSIONS	Axitinib administered in a week-on/week-off schedule combined with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX is supported by ( 18 ) FLT-PET data and was well tolerated in patients with gastrointestinal tumours ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of olive oil and flaxseed oil compared with mineral oil for the treatment of constipation in patients undergoing hemodialysis . METHODS	A 4-week , double-blind , randomized , and controlled trial was conducted . METHODS	Fifty constipated patients ( 29 % male , 5112years ) diagnosed by the Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to receive mineral oil ( control group ; n = 17 ) , olive oil ( n = 16 ) , or flaxseed oil ( n = 17 ) . METHODS	The initial oil dose was 4mL/day , and adjustments during the follow-up could be made as needed . METHODS	The impact of the intervention was assessed by the Rome III criteria scores . RESULTS	The most frequent symptoms of constipation evaluated by the Roma III criteria at baseline were comparable among the groups and included `` incomplete evacuation '' ( 92 % ) , `` lumpy or hard stools , '' ( 72 % ) and `` anorectal obstruction '' ( 70 % ) . RESULTS	The Rome III score improved significantly in patients receiving mineral oil ( 10.55.0 to 4.14.0 ; P < .01 ) , olive oil ( 10.34.2 to 3.23.8 ; P = .01 ) , and flaxseed oil ( 9.64.2 to 6.05.1 ; P < .01 ) , with no significant group-by-time interaction ( P = .15 ) . RESULTS	The scores of 5 from 6 constipation symptoms reduced similarly in the mineral oil and olive oil groups , whereas only the frequency of evacuation and the consistency of stools improved in the flaxseed oil group . CONCLUSIONS	We demonstrated that the daily use of olive oil or flaxseed oil was as effective as mineral oil in the treatment of constipation in patients undergoing hemodialysis ."
"OBJECTIVE	In myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) , abdominal activity often interferes with the evaluation of perfusion in the inferior wall , especially after pharmacological stress . OBJECTIVE	In this randomized study , we examined the effect of carbonated water intake versus still water intake on the quality of images obtained during myocardial perfusion images ( MPI ) studies . METHODS	A total of 467 MIBI studies were randomized into a carbonated water group and a water group . METHODS	The presence of intestinal activity adjacent to the inferior wall was evaluated by two observers . METHODS	Furthermore , a semi-quantitative analysis was performed in the adenosine subgroup , using a count ratio of the inferior myocardial wall and adjacent abdominal activity . RESULTS	The need for repeated SPECT in the adenosine studies was 5.3 % in the carbonated water group versus 19.4 % in the still water group ( p = 0.019 ) . RESULTS	The inferior wall-to-abdomen count ratio was significantly higher in the carbonated water group compared to the still water group ( 2.11 1.00 vs. 1.72 0.73 , p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The effect of carbonated water during rest and after exercise was not significant . CONCLUSIONS	This randomized study showed that carbonated water significantly reduced the interference of extra-cardiac activity in adenosine SPECT MPI ."

BACKGROUND	Spasmofen ( ) is a brand of Amriya Pharmaceutical Industries in the form of rectal suppositories containing ketoprofen 100 mg and hyoscine butylbromide 10 mg . BACKGROUND	This combination is intended for the rapid relief of severe colicky pain in the renal system , hepatobiliary system , or gastrointestinal tract . BACKGROUND	This trial aims to compare a single-dose of Spasmofen rectal suppository to a single intravenous ( IV ) ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg/2 mL dose in patients with acute renal colic . METHODS	A total of 80 eligible consecutive patients presenting to the emergency departments of two medical centers with acute renal colic were included in the study . METHODS	Eligible patients who signed the informed consent were randomly assigned into two treatment groups : an experimental group ( Spasmofen group ) who received one Spasmofen rectal suppository plus an IV injection of 2 mL of normal saline solution ; and a control group ( ketorolac group ) who received one ketorolac 30 mg/2 mL ampoule IV plus one placebo suppository . METHODS	Treatment success , defined as a change in the verbal rating score from severe or moderate pain to none or mild at 60 minutes after the dose , was compared between groups using the chi-square/Fisher 's exact test . METHODS	Percentage reductions in visual pain analog scale ( VPAS ) scores at 15 and 60 minutes after the dose were compared between groups using the Z-test for proportions . RESULTS	Successful treatment at 60 minutes occurred in 35 of 40 ( 87.5 % ) of Spasmofen-treated patients and in 33 of 40 ( 82.5 % ) of ketorolac-treated patients . RESULTS	The difference was not statistically significant by Fisher 's exact test ( P = 0.755 ) . RESULTS	The mean percentage reduction of VPAS after 15 minutes was 61.82 % in the Spasmofen-treated group and 64.76 % in the ketorolac-treated group . RESULTS	The difference was also not statistically significant by the Z-test for proportions ( P = 0.795 ) . RESULTS	Sixty minutes after being treated , Spasmofen was associated with a statistically significant greater reduction in VPAS ( mean % reduction = 92.36 % ) than ketorolac ( 75.06 % ; P = 0.0466 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Single-dose Spasmofen rectal suppository might be a safe and effective first-aid treatment for the emergency department relief of acute renal colic ."
"BACKGROUND	Surgical site infection ( SSI ) is the second most common type of nosocomial infections in the United States . BACKGROUND	In Uruguay , the incidence after prostatectomies is 2.6 % . BACKGROUND	The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of two skin antiseptics and to determine possible risk factors for SSI in patients undergoing surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . METHODS	A randomized trial included 70 patients operated on for BPH , of whom 56 ( 80 % ) underwent open surgery . METHODS	Patients were treated by the same surgical team in a tertiary general hospital that is a referral center for patients with urologic diseases . METHODS	Skin antisepsis was performed randomly using either 0.5 % povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine in an alcohol base ( Chemisol ( ) ) . METHODS	Possible risk factors investigated were age , renal dysfunction , bladder stones , preoperative urinary catheter , positive preoperative urine culture , operative time and technique , and vesicocutaneous fistula . RESULTS	Of all patients , 41 ( 59 % ) had a urinary catheter preoperatively . RESULTS	Urine cultures were positive in 31 patients , of whom 29 ( 94 % ) had a urinary catheter . RESULTS	Surgical site infection occurred in 10 patients ( 18 % ) , and 100 % of the causative microorganisms were gram-negative bacteria characteristic of the urinary flora . RESULTS	The type of antiseptic did not affect the risk of SSI ( p = 1.00 ) . RESULTS	The most important risk factor for infection was the presence of a urinary catheter preoperatively ( p = 0.003 ) ; also significant were the formation of a vesicocutaneous fistula ( p = 0.008 ) , increasing age ( p = 0.02 ) , and the presence of a positive preoperative urine culture ( p = 0.03 ) . CONCLUSIONS	In a cohort of patients submitted to open prostatectomy , SSI was not related to the type of antiseptic . CONCLUSIONS	The main risk factor was the presence of a urinary catheter preoperatively . CONCLUSIONS	All microorganisms isolated from the SSIs were characteristic of urinary tract infections ."
"BACKGROUND	Sedation using intranasal dexmedetomidine is a convenient and well-tolerated technique . BACKGROUND	This study evaluated the sedative efficacy of intranasal dexmedetomidine in combination with patient-controlled sedation ( PCS ) for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . METHODS	In this double-blind , randomised , controlled trial , 50 patients received either intranasal dexmedetomidine 1.5 g/kg ( dexmedetomidine group ) or intranasal saline ( placebo group ) 1h before the procedure . METHODS	PCS with propofol and alfentanil was provided for rescue sedation . METHODS	Additional sedative consumption , perioperative sedation scores using Observer 's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation ( OAA/S ) scale , recovery , vital signs , adverse events and patient satisfaction were assessed . RESULTS	Total consumption of PCS propofol and alfentanil was significantly less in the dexmedetomidine than placebo group with a mean difference of -13.8 mg propofol ( 95 % confidence interval -27.3 to -0.3 ) and -34.5 g alfentanil ( 95 % confidence interval -68.2 to -0.7 ) at the completion of the procedure ( P = 0.044 ) . RESULTS	Weighted areas under the curve ( AUCw ) of OAA/S scores were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group before , during and after procedures ( P < 0.001 , P = 0.024 and P = 0.041 respectively ) . RESULTS	AUCw of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were also significantly lower during the procedure ( P = 0.007 and P = 0.022 respectively ) with dexmedetomidine . RESULTS	There was no difference in recovery , side effects or satisfaction . CONCLUSIONS	Intranasal dexmedetomidine with PCS propofol and alfentanil confers deeper perioperative clinical sedation with significantly less use of additional sedatives during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ."
"OBJECTIVE	To develop a mathematical model to adjust the timing of computed tomography ( CT ) scans with the hazard of cancer recurrence in time to facilitate early detection of cancer recurrence . METHODS	The clinical data were extracted from the randomized Scandinavian Sarcoma Group ( SSG ) XVIII/Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie ( AIO ) trial database . METHODS	The SSG XVIII/AIO trial was registered ( trial no . METHODS	NCT00116935 ) and approved by the national or institutional review boards . METHODS	In the trial , 1 - and 3-year durations of adjuvant imatinib mesylate in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) were compared . METHODS	A nonhomogeneous Poisson model with a piecewise log-constant hazard in time that accounts for the nonlinear pattern of GIST recurrence was applied to tumor site , mitotic count , and recurrence data . METHODS	The optimal times to obtain follow-up CT scans were computed by modifying the frequency of CT scans with the hazard of tumor recurrence in time . METHODS	The hazard-adjusted follow-up schedules were compared with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guidelines of the United States , which suggest imaging with CT at intervals of 3-6 months for 3-5 years and then annually . RESULTS	Optimized timing of CT scans on the basis of hazard of recurrence resulted in follow-up schedule options where CT is performed more sparsely than in the NCCN guidelines during adjuvant imatinib administration and more frequently , at approximately 3-month intervals , during the first 2 years that follow imatinib discontinuation when the risk of recurrence was the greatest . RESULTS	The number of CT scans could be reduced by a median of 31 % ( from 13 to nine ) compared with the standard schedules within the first 6 years of follow-up without increasing the delay in recurrence detection . CONCLUSIONS	Detection of GIST recurrence may be enhanced by adjusting the timing of the CT scans with the hazard of recurrence . CONCLUSIONS	The method may be applicable to other human tumor types . CONCLUSIONS	Online supplemental material is available for this article ."
"OBJECTIVE	To establish the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in ovine gastrointestinal nematodes in southern Queensland . METHODS	An observational parasitological study using the faecal egg count reduction test . METHODS	Sheep farms ( n = 20 ) enrolled in this study met the twin criteria of using worm testing for drench decisions and having concerns about anthelmintic efficacy . METHODS	On each farm , 105 sheep were randomly allocated to one of six treatment groups or an untreated control group . METHODS	Faecal samples were collected on day 0 and days 10-14 for worm egg counts and larval differentiation . METHODS	Single - and multi-combination anthelmintics , persistent and non-persistent , oral liquid or capsule , pour-on and injectable formulations were tested . METHODS	Monepantel was not tested . METHODS	Farmers also responded to a questionnaire on drenching practices . RESULTS	Haemonchus contortus was the predominant species . RESULTS	Efficacy < 95 % was recorded on 85 % of farms for one or more anthelmintics and on 10 % of farms for six anthelmintics . RESULTS	No resistance was identified on three farms . RESULTS	The 4-way combination product was efficacious ( n = 4 farms ) . RESULTS	Napthalophos resistance was detected on one farm only . RESULTS	Resistance to levamisole ( 42 % of farms ) , moxidectin injection ( 50 % of farms ) and the closantel/abamectin combination ( 67 % of farms ) was identified . RESULTS	Moxidectin oral was efficacious against Trichostrongylus colubriformis , which was predominant on only one farm . RESULTS	Of the farms tested , 55 % ran meat breeds , 60 % dosed more than the recommended dose rate and 70 % always , mostly or when possible practised a ` drench and move ' strategy . CONCLUSIONS	This level of anthelmintic resistance in southern Queensland will severely compromise worm control and force increased use of monepantel ."
"OBJECTIVE	Insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway ( NPA ) during endoscopic sedation is only recommended in the event of respiratory problems . OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the safety and efficacy of routine insertion of an NPA during sedation in gastrointestinal ( GI ) endoscopy . METHODS	Between July 2009 and April 2012 , patients with colonoscopy or expected longer-lasting or therapeutic upper GI endoscopy were pseudo-randomized in a weekly alternating fashion to perform sedation ( midazolam in combination with propofol ) with or without NPA insertion . METHODS	The primary outcome measure was respiratory depression ( oxygen saturation < 90 % ) . METHODS	Secondary measures included hypotension ( systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg ) , bradycardia ( heart rate < 40 beats/min ) or nasopharyngeal damage after NPA insertion . RESULTS	216 ( 106 females , mean age 60.7 9.65 years ) were enrolled . RESULTS	Colonoscopy was performed in 131 patients and upper endoscopy in 85 patients . RESULTS	In 105 patients an NPA was used ( intervention group ) . RESULTS	Five ( 4.7 % ) of those patients showed minor nasopharyngeal injury . RESULTS	Respiratory depression ( 13.5 vs. 1.9 % , p = 0.002 ) and hypotension ( 11 vs. 5 % , p = 0.09 ) occurred more frequently in the control than in the intervention group . CONCLUSIONS	The routine placement of an NPA can reduce the frequency of hypoxemic events during endoscopic sedation with minor risks for nasopharyngeal injury ."
"OBJECTIVE	Postoperative sore throat is one of the most common problems after tonsillectomy . OBJECTIVE	Antibiotics remove the local flora and reduce inflammation and thus may reduce postoperative pain after tonsillectomy . OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of topical sucralfate and clindamycin on local pain reduction after tonsillectomy in children aged 6 to 12 years . METHODS	Triple-blind randomized clinical trial of children aged 6 to 12 years with sleep apnea or snoring due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy and chronic airway obstruction or with chronic infections who were candidates for tonsillectomy at Besat Hospital , Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , from May to October 2013 .

"BACKGROUND	There is limited evidence with regard to the effect of different sources of protein on appetite during weight loss . BACKGROUND	Vegetarian and meat-based high-protein diets may have contrasting effects on appetite and biomarkers of protein-induced satiety . OBJECTIVE	The aim was to assess appetite response to meat or vegetarian high-protein weight-loss ( HPWL ) diets in obese men to monitor plasma amino acid profile and gut peptide response as potential satiety biomarkers . METHODS	Twenty obese [ body mass index ( in kg/m ) : 34.8 ] men participated in a dietary intervention study . METHODS	After 3 d of a maintenance diet , they were provided in a crossover design with either a vegetarian HPWL ( Soy-HPWL ) or a meat-based HPWL ( Meat-HPWL ) diet for 2 wk . METHODS	Both diets comprised 30 % protein , 30 % fat , and 40 % carbohydrate , provided to measured resting metabolic rate . METHODS	Body weight and the motivation to eat were measured daily . METHODS	Plasma satiety biomarkers were collected during a test-meal challenge ( 5 h ) at the end of each diet period . RESULTS	Over the 2 wk , subjects lost , on average , 2.41 and 2.27 kg with consumption of the Soy - and Meat-HPWL diets , respectively [ P = 0.352 ; SE of the difference ( SED ) : 0.1 ] . RESULTS	ANOVA confirmed that subjectively rated hunger ( P = 0.569 ; SED : 3.8 ) , fullness ( P = 0.404 ; SED : 4.1 ) , desire to eat ( P = 0.356 ; SED : 3.7 ) , preservation of lean body mass ( P = 0.334 ; SED : 0.2 ) , and loss of percentage fat mass ( P = 0.179 ; SED : 0.2 ) did not differ between the 2 HPWL diets . RESULTS	There were differences in absolute concentrations of ghrelin and peptide YY between the 2 HPWL diets , although the response as net area under the curve was not different . CONCLUSIONS	Appetite control and weight loss were similar for both HPWL diets . CONCLUSIONS	Gut hormone profile was similar between the diets , which suggests that vegetarian diets can be as effective as meat-based diets for appetite control during weight loss ."
"BACKGROUND	Preoperative short-term radiotherapy ( PRT ) in combination with total mesorectal excision ( TME ) has shown to improve local control in rectal cancer treatment , however without a survival benefit and at the cost of increased morbidity . BACKGROUND	The current study investigates the long-term health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) of patients 14 years after treatment in the Dutch TME trial . METHODS	In the TME trial ( 1996-1999 ) 1530 Dutch patients with rectal cancer were treated with TME and randomly assigned to PRT ( 5 5 Gy ) . METHODS	In 2012 HRQL was evaluated in surviving patients ( n = 606 ) using a questionnaire combining EORTC QLQ-C30 , EORTC QLQ-CR29 and additional questions . RESULTS	Results were obtained from 478 patients ( 82 % ) , with a median follow up of 14 years . RESULTS	PRT+TME patients without stoma reported more faecal leakage and higher stool frequency , resulting in increased need of pads . RESULTS	Furthermore , irradiated males reported more erection problems . RESULTS	However , radiotherapy did not have negative effects on overall functioning . RESULTS	Compared with Dutch population , patients in both treatment arms reported a small decrease in overall functioning and males reported less sexual activity , interest and enjoyment and more erection difficulties . RESULTS	Irradiated females reported more vaginal dryness and more pain at intercourse compared with Dutch population . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term HRQL evaluation shows that treatment-related symptoms are still present 14 years after treatment for rectal cancer . CONCLUSIONS	Radiotherapy increased bowel dysfunction in patients without stoma . CONCLUSIONS	Compared with the Dutch population , both groups reported increased sexual dysfunction . CONCLUSIONS	Despite these treatment-related symptoms , there was no difference in overall functioning and global health between TME and PRT+TME ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of 2 prophylaxis regimens before cataract surgery using topical antibiotics ( 1 hour before surgery versus the day before ) , both with povidone-iodine , with regard to reducing the preoperative conjunctival bacterial load . METHODS	Tertiary ophthalmic referral center , Munich , Germany . METHODS	Prospective comparative case series . METHODS	Eyes were treated with topical antibiotics and their conjunctival sac flush irrigated using 10 mL of povidone-iodine 1.0 % . METHODS	All eyes were randomized to receive either 4 applications of topical 3500 IU/mL neomycin sulfate/6000 IU/mL polymyxin-B sulfate within 1 hour preoperatively ( Group 1 ) or on the day before surgery ( Group 2 ) . METHODS	Conjunctival specimens were obtained at 4 timepoints : T0C untreated fellow eye ( control ) , T0 surgery eye ( after antibiotic prophylaxis but before povidone-iodine irrigation ) , T1 after povidone-iodine , and T2 at the conclusion of surgery . METHODS	All specimens were inoculated onto blood and chocolate-blood agar and into thioglycollate broth . RESULTS	One hundred thirty-three eyes of 133 consecutive patients were included ( Group 1 , 64 eyes ; Group 2 , 69 eyes ) . RESULTS	The antibiotic regimens were equally effective in reducing the aerobic and microaerophilic conjunctival flora ( Group 1 , P = .028 ; Group 2 , P = .000 ) , but had no significant effect on anaerobic bacteria ( Group 1 , P = .201 ; Group 2 , P = .117 ) . RESULTS	Flush irrigation of the conjunctival sac using 10.0 mL povidone-iodine 1.0 % significantly decreased the conjunctival bacterial load in both groups . CONCLUSIONS	Topical neomycin/polymyxin-B was equally effective in reducing the conjunctival bacterial load whether given 1 day or 1 hour before surgery . CONCLUSIONS	The greatest effect was achieved by irrigating the conjunctival sac using povidone-iodine .

"OBJECTIVE	We examined the effect of a single apple juice intake on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine enantiomers in healthy Japanese subjects . METHODS	In a randomized two phase , open-label crossover study , 14 subjects received 60mg of racemic fexofenadine simultaneously with water or apple juice . METHODS	For the uptake studies , oocytes expressing organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2B1 ( OATP2B1 ) were incubated with 100M ( R ) - and ( S ) - fexofenadine in the presence or absence of 10 % apple juice . RESULTS	One-time ingestion of apple juice significantly decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC0-24 ) for ( R ) - and ( S ) - fexofenadine by 49 and 59 % , respectively , and prolonged the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration ( t max ) of both enantiomers ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Although apple juice greatly reduced the amount of ( R ) - and ( S ) - fexofenadine excretion into urine ( Ae0-24 ) by 54 and 58 % , respectively , the renal clearances of both enantiomers were unchanged between the control and apple juice phases . RESULTS	For in vitro uptake studies , the uptake of both fexofenadine enantiomers into OATP2B1 complementary RNA ( cRNA ) - injected oocytes was significantly higher than that into water-injected oocytes , and this effect was greater for ( R ) - fexofenadine . RESULTS	In addition , apple juice significantly decreased the uptake of both enantiomers into OATP2B1 cRNA-injected oocytes . CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that OATP2B1 plays an important role in the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine and that one-time apple juice ingestion probably inhibits intestinal OATP2B1-mediated transport of both enantiomers . CONCLUSIONS	In addition , this study demonstrates that the OATP2B1 inhibition effect does not require repeated ingestion or a large volume of apple juice ."
"OBJECTIVE	Postpericardiotomy syndrome , postoperative atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , and postoperative effusions may be responsible for increased morbidity and health care costs after cardiac surgery . OBJECTIVE	Postoperative use of colchicine prevented these complications in a single trial . OBJECTIVE	To determine the efficacy and safety of perioperative use of oral colchicine in reducing postpericardiotomy syndrome , postoperative AF , and postoperative pericardial or pleural effusions . METHODS	Investigator-initiated , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial among 360 consecutive candidates for cardiac surgery enrolled in 11 Italian centers between March 2012 and March 2014 . METHODS	At enrollment , mean age of the trial participants was 67.5 years ( SD , 10.6 years ) , 69 % were men , and 36 % had planned valvular surgery . METHODS	Main exclusion criteria were absence of sinus rhythm at enrollment , cardiac transplantation , and contraindications to colchicine . METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive placebo ( n = 180 ) or colchicine ( 0.5 mg twice daily in patients 70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily in patients < 70 kg ; n = 180 ) starting between 48 and 72 hours before surgery and continued for 1 month after surgery . METHODS	Occurrence of postpericardiotomy syndrome within 3 months ; main secondary study end points were postoperative AF and pericardial or pleural effusion . RESULTS	The primary end point of postpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 35 patients ( 19.4 % ) assigned to colchicine and in 53 ( 29.4 % ) assigned to placebo ( absolute difference , 10.0 % ; 95 % CI , 1.1 % -18.7 % ; number needed to treat = 10 ) . RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the colchicine and placebo groups for the secondary end points of postoperative AF ( colchicine , 61 patients [ 33.9 % ] ; placebo , 75 patients [ 41.7 % ] ; absolute difference , 7.8 % ; 95 % CI , -2.2 % to 17.6 % ) or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion ( colchicine , 103 patients [ 57.2 % ] ; placebo , 106 patients [ 58.9 % ] ; absolute difference , 1.7 % ; 95 % CI , -8.5 % to 11.7 % ) , although there was a reduction in postoperative AF in the prespecified on-treatment analysis ( placebo , 61/148 patients [ 41.2 % ] ; colchicine , 38/141 patients [ 27.0 % ] ; absolute difference , 14.2 % ; 95 % CI , 3.3 % -24.7 % ) . RESULTS	Adverse events occurred in 21 patients ( 11.7 % ) in the placebo group vs 36 ( 20.0 % ) in the colchicine group ( absolute difference , 8.3 % ; 95 % CI ; 0.76 % -15.9 % ; number needed to harm = 12 ) , but discontinuation rates were similar . RESULTS	No serious adverse events were observed . CONCLUSIONS	Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery , perioperative use of colchicine compared with placebo reduced the incidence of postpericardiotomy syndrome but not of postoperative AF or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion .

OBJECTIVE	Potential effects of training programs on the patients ' quality of life , physical performance , physical activity in daily living , and biological parameters were exploratorily evaluated . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to a resistance ( RET ) and aerobic exercise training group ( AET ) . METHODS	Both underwent supervised training sessions twice a week for 12 weeks . METHODS	RET was performed at 60-80 % of the one-repetition maximum and consisted of 2-3 sets of 15-25 repetitions . METHODS	The AET group performed endurance training at 60-80 % of their predetermined pulse rate ( for 10 to 30 min ) . RESULTS	A total of 26 gastrointestinal cancer patients could be randomized . RESULTS	Twenty-one patients completed the 12 weeks of intervention . RESULTS	The median adherence rate to exercise training of all 26 patients was 65 % , while in patients who were able to complete 12 weeks , adherence was 75 % . RESULTS	The fatigue score of all patients decreased from 66 to 43 post-intervention . RESULTS	Sleeping duration increased in both groups and muscular strength increased in the RET group . RESULTS	A higher number of steps in daily living was associated with higher levels of physical and social functioning as well as lower scores for pain and fatigue . CONCLUSIONS	RET and AET are feasible in gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy . CONCLUSIONS	Both training programs seem to improve cancer-related symptoms as well as the patient 's physical activities of daily living ."
"OBJECTIVE	This exploratory trial was performed to determine whether Daikenchuto accelerates recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing open colectomy for colon cancer . METHODS	A total of 386 patients undergoing colectomy at 1 of the 51 clinical trial sites in Japan from January 2009 to June 2011 were registered for the study ( JFMC39-0902 ) . METHODS	Patients received either placebo or Daikenchuto ( 15.0 g/day , t.i.d ) between post-operative day 2 and post-operative day 8 . METHODS	Primary end-points included time to first bowel movement , frequency of bowel movement and stool form . METHODS	The incidence of intestinal obstruction was evaluated post-operatively . METHODS	The safety profile of Daikenchuto until post-operative day 8 was also evaluated . RESULTS	The results for 336 patients ( Daikenchuto , n = 174 ; placebo , n = 162 ) were available for statistical analysis . RESULTS	The time to first bowel movement did not differ significantly between the two groups . RESULTS	All patients reported having diarrhea or soft stools immediately after surgery , and the time until stool normalization ( 50th percentile ) in the Daikenchuto and placebo groups was 6 days and 7 days , respectively . RESULTS	The placebo group had a significantly greater number of hard stools at post-operative day 8 ( P = 0.016 ) , and bowel movement frequency continued to increase until post-operative day 8 as well . RESULTS	In contrast , bowel movement frequency in the Daikenchuto group increased until post-operative day 6 , however decreased from post-operative day 7 and was significantly lower at post-operative day 8 compared with the placebo group ( P = 0.024 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The moderate effects of Daikenchuto were observed 1 week after the operation . CONCLUSIONS	Although Daikenchuto had an effect on gastrointestinal function after open surgery in patients with colon cancer , this study did not show its clinical benefits adequately ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy of lubiprostone compared to Senna on bowel symptoms and constipation in post-operative orthopedic patients treated with opioids . METHODS	In this double blind , randomized , active comparator trial , adults who required opioids for analgesia following orthopedic procedures and who were admitted in inpatient rehabilitation were randomized following baseline assessments to lubiprostone ( Amitza ( ) ) , orally twice a day or Senna ( generic ) two capsules administered daily for six days . METHODS	Subjects were assessed using the patient assessment of constipation ( PAC ) - symptoms ( PAC-SYM ) and the PAC-quality of life ( PAC-QOL ) scales measured at baseline and Day 7 ; Subjects were assessed daily for secondary measures included the Bristol stool scale bowel consistency , specific bowel symptom score ( Nausea , cramping , straining , completeness , abdominal pain , time per lavatory attempt , assistance needed ) , adverse events and rescue medications required . METHODS	Function was measured using the functional independence measure ( FIM ) at admission and discharge ; length of stay ( LOS ) and missed treatments due to gastrointestinal symptoms were also assessed . RESULTS	64 adults were enrolled ; 56 participants ( 28 in each group ) had baseline and follow up measures and were included in the intention to treat ( ITT ) analyses . RESULTS	43 participants completed the study , 21 in the active lubiprostone and 22 in the active Senna group . RESULTS	The mean age of the participants was 71.5 years ( SD = 11.4 years , range : 28-96 years ) . RESULTS	In the ITT analyses , participants showed significant improvement in bowel symptoms as measured by the PAC-SYM ( mean SD , -0.28 0.60 , range : -1 -2.33 ) and PAC-QOL ( mean SD , 0.33 0.81 , range : -1.5 -2.0 ) over time , but there were no significant differences between the lubiprostone and Senna groups in mean change in the PAC-SYM ( -0.20 0.60 vs -0.36 0.61 , P = 0.61 respectively ) or the PAC-QOL ( 0.29 0.76 vs 0.37 0.87 , P = 0.61 respectively ) . RESULTS	The mean change in each bowel symptom also did not significantly differ between treatment groups on ITT analyses , except for completeness of bowel movement , with the Senna group showing greater negative mean change in bowel movement completeness ( -0.56 1.01 vs -2.00 1.41 , P = 0.03 ) and for reduction of abdominal pain , favoring Senna ( -0.14 0.73 vs -0.73 1.08 , P = 0.04 ) . RESULTS	Fifteen ( 75 % ) participants in the lubiprostone and in the Senna group requested rescue treatments . RESULTS	Participants made significant functional improvement from admission to discharge over a median LOS of 12 d , with a mean FIM change of 29.13 13.58 and no significant between group differences ( 27.0 9.2 vs 31.5 16.6 , P = 0.27 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Both lubiprostone and Senna improved constipation-related symptoms and QOL in opioid-induced constipation , with no significant between-group differences ."
"OBJECTIVE	Gastric intestinal metaplasia ( GIM ) is associated with a risk for development of intestinal-type gastric cancer . OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to compare the diagnostic yield of GIM from confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) and white light endoscopy ( WLE ) . METHODS	In a prospective , double-blind , randomized study , patients were randomly assigned to receive either CLE with targeted biopsies ( group A ) or WLE with a standard biopsy protocol ( group B ) . RESULTS	A total of 168 patients were finally analyzed ( group A 85 , group B 83 ) . RESULTS	On a per-patient analysis , the diagnostic yields of GIM ( including GIM with gastric intraepithelial neoplasia [ GIN ] ) for groups A and B were 44.71 % and 31.33 % , respectively ( P = 0.074 ) . RESULTS	On a per-biopsy analysis , CLE-targeted biopsy gave a significantly higher diagnostic yield of GIM compared with WLE and standard biopsy , at 65.70 % ( 113/172 biopsies ) versus 15.73 % ( 81/515 biopsies ) ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Moreover , the diagnostic yield of the operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia ( OLGIM ) assessment stages III and IV was higher at 20.93 % ( 36/172 biopsies ) in group A versus 4.08 % ( 21/515 biopsies ) in group B ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	In addition , use of CLE-guided biopsy significantly decreased by 68 % ( P < 0.001 ) the mean number of biopsies required per patient . CONCLUSIONS	CLE with targeted biopsies is superior to WLE with standard biopsies for the detection and surveillance of GIM . CONCLUSIONS	The number of biopsies needed to confirm GIM is about one third of that needed with WLE with standard biopsies ."
"BACKGROUND	Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) remains an important cause of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease worldwide . BACKGROUND	Treatment of H. pylori infection is one of the effective ways to prevent gastric cancer . BACKGROUND	However , standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication is no longer effective in many countries , including Thailand . BACKGROUND	This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of adding bismuth and probiotic to standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication . METHODS	In this prospective single center study , H. pylori infected gastritis patients were randomized to receive 7 - or 14-day standard triple therapy plus bismuth with probiotic or placebo . METHODS	Treatment regimen consisted of 30 mg lansoprazole twice daily , 1 g amoxicillin twice daily , 1 g clarithromycin MR once daily and 1,048 mg bismuth subsalicylate twice daily . METHODS	Probiotic bacteria composed of Bifidobacterium lactis , Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei . METHODS	Placebo was conventional drinking yogurt without probiotic . METHODS	CYP2C19 genotyping and antibiotic susceptibility tests were also done . METHODS	H pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test at least 2 weeks after completion of treatment . RESULTS	One hundred subjects were enrolled ( 25 each to 7 - and 14-day regimens with probiotic or placebo ) . RESULTS	Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed 36.7 % metronidazole and 1.1 % clarithromycin resistance . RESULTS	CYP2C19 genotyping revealed 40.8 % , 49 % and 10.2 % were rapid , intermediate and poor metabolizers , respectively . RESULTS	The eradication rates of 7 - or 14 regimens with probiotics were 100 % . RESULTS	Regarding adverse events , the incidence of bitter taste was significantly lower in the 7 - day regimen with the probiotic group compared with 7 - day regimen with placebo ( 40 % vs. 64 % ; p = 0.04 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The 7-day standard triple therapy plus bismuth and probiotic can provide an excellent cure rate of H. pylori ( 100 % ) in areas with low clarithromycin resistance such as Thailand , regardless of CYP2C19 genotype . CONCLUSIONS	Adding a probiotic also reduced treatment-related adverse events ."
"BACKGROUND	Angiogenesis is a valid target in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer . BACKGROUND	Trebananib inhibits the binding of angiopoietins 1 and 2 to the Tie2 receptor , and thereby inhibits angiogenesis . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether the addition of trebananib to single-agent weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer improved progression-free survival . METHODS	For this randomised , double-blind phase 3 study undertaken between Nov 10 , 2010 , and Nov 19 , 2012 , we enrolled women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer from 32 countries . METHODS	Patient eligibility criteria included having been treated with three or fewer previous regimens , and a platinum-free interval of less than 12 months . METHODS	We enrolled patients with a computerised interactive voice response system , and patients were randomly assigned using a permuted block method ( block size of four ) in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly intravenous paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m ( 2 ) ) plus either weekly masked intravenous placebo or trebananib ( 15 mg/kg ) . METHODS	Patients were stratified on the basis of platinum-free interval ( 0 and 6 months vs > 6 and 12 months ) , presence or absence of measurable disease , and region ( North America , western Europe and Australia , or rest of world ) . METHODS	The sponsor , investigators , site staff , and patients were masked to the treatment assignment . METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population . METHODS	The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT01204749 , and is no longer accruing patients . RESULTS	919 patients were enrolled , of whom 461 were randomly assigned to the trebananib group and 458 to the placebo group . RESULTS	Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the trebananib group than in the placebo group ( 72 months [ 58-74 ] vs 54 months [ 95 % CI 43-55 ] , respectively , hazard ratio 066 , 95 % CI 057-077 , p < 00001 ) . RESULTS	Incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar between treatment groups ( 244 [ 54 % ] of 452 patients in the placebo group vs 258 [ 56 % ] of 461 patients in the trebananib group ) . RESULTS	Trebananib was associated with more adverse event-related treatment discontinuations than was placebo ( 77 [ 17 % ] patients vs 27 [ 6 % ] , respectively ) and higher incidences of oedema ( 294 [ 64 % ] patients had any-grade oedema in the trebananib group vs 127 [ 28 % ] patients in the placebo group ) . RESULTS	Grade 3 or higher adverse events included ascites ( 34 [ 8 % ] in the placebo group vs 52 [ 11 % ] in the trebananib group ) , neutropenia ( 40 [ 9 % ] vs 26 [ 6 % ] ) , and abdominal pain ( 21 [ 5 % ] vs 22 [ 5 % ] ) . RESULTS	We recorded serious adverse events in 125 ( 28 % ) patients in the placebo group and 159 ( 34 % ) patients in the trebananib group . RESULTS	There was a difference of 2 % or less in class-specific adverse events associated with anti-VEGF therapy ( hypertension , proteinuria , wound-healing complications , thrombotic events , gastrointestinal perforations ) , except bleeding , which was more common in the placebo group than in the trebananib group ( 75 [ 17 % ] vs 46 [ 10 % ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of angiopoietins 1 and 2 with trebananib provided a clinically meaningful prolongation in progression-free survival . CONCLUSIONS	This non-VEGF anti-angiogenesis option for women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer should be investigated in other settings and in combination with additional agents . CONCLUSIONS	Although oedema was increased , typical anti-VEGF associated adverse events were not prominent . BACKGROUND	Amgen ."
"BACKGROUND	Multicentre radiotherapy clinical trials can incorporate quality assurance ( QA ) procedures for ensuring consistent application of the trial protocol in the planning , delivery and reporting of participant treatments . BACKGROUND	Subsequently detected variations from trial protocol have previously been shown to reduce treatment efficacy , although little has been shown for toxicity rates . BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of QA measures and protocol variations on toxicity incidence in the context of a prostate radiotherapy trial . METHODS	Using QA records from the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial , the impact of variations on gastrointestinal ( GI ) and genito-urinary ( GU ) toxicities was investigated . RESULTS	Protocol variation rates were lower than reported in previous studies , and showed little correlation with GI toxicity outcomes . RESULTS	Variations classified as ` major ' showed a non-significant trend for increased toxicity relative to those classified as ` minor ' . RESULTS	Results from a Level III phantom-based dosimetry study showed some correlation with GI toxicity , whereas ranking on a set-up accuracy study did not impact on toxicity . RESULTS	Toxicity in general increased with the number of participants accrued per centre , at odds with previous reports relating to disease progression , with a potential link to increases in low-mid-range rectal doses in the cohort from higher-accruing centres . RESULTS	No QA-related variables correlated with GU toxicities . CONCLUSIONS	Besides non-significant trends , minimal association was observed between QA variables and toxicity rates for the RADAR trial . CONCLUSIONS	The intention of the trial 's QA programme was to reduce treatment variations and minimise toxicity in the context of a relevantly advanced treatment approach ."
"OBJECTIVE	To determine whether re-feeding of gastric residual volumes reduces the time needed to achieve full enteral feeding in preterm infants . METHODS	Parallel-group randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio . METHODS	Regional referral neonatal intensive care unit . METHODS	72 infants of gestational age 23 ( 0/7 ) to 28 ( 6/7 ) weeks receiving minimal enteral nutrition ( < 24 mL/kg/day ) during the first week after birth . METHODS	Infants were randomised to either be re-fed with gastric residual volumes ( Re-feeding group ) or receive fresh formula/human milk ( Fresh-feeding group ) whenever large gastric residual volumes were noted . METHODS	The primary efficacy end point was time to achieve full enteral feeding ( 120 mL/kg/day ) after randomisation . RESULTS	The mean time to full enteral feeding was 10.0 days in the Re-feeding group and 11.3 days in the Fresh-feeding group ( mean difference favouring re-feeding : -1.3 days ; 95 % CI -2.9 to 0.3 ; p = 0.11 ) . RESULTS	The composite safety end point of spontaneous intestinal perforation , surgical necrotising enterocolitis , or death occurred in 6 of 36 infants ( 17 % ) in the Re-feeding group versus 10 of 36 infants ( 28 % ) in the Fresh-feeding group ( p = 0.26 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Re-feeding gastric residual volumes in extremely preterm infants does not reduce time to achieve full enteral feeding . CONCLUSIONS	This trial suggests that re-feeding might be as safe as fresh feeding , but further research is needed , due to lack of sufficient statistical power in this study for safety analysis .

"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the therapeutic value of Gastrografin in shortening duration of prolonged postoperative ileus ( PPOI ) after elective colorectal surgery . BACKGROUND	Gut wall edema is central to the pathogenesis of PPOI . BACKGROUND	Hyperosmotic , orally administered , water-soluble contrast media such as Gastrografin are theoretically capable of mitigating this edema . METHODS	A double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomized trial was conducted . METHODS	Participants were allocated to receive 100 mL of Gastrografin ( Exposure Group ) or flavored distilled water ( Control Group ) administered enterally . METHODS	Other aspects of management were standardized . METHODS	Resolution of PPOI was assessed 12-hourly . RESULTS	Eighty patients were randomized equally , with 5 in the Exposure Group and 4 in the Control Group excluded from analysis . RESULTS	Participants were evenly matched at baseline . RESULTS	Mean duration of PPOI did not differ between Exposure and Control Groups ( 83.7 vs 101.3 hours ; P = 0.191 ) . RESULTS	When considering individual markers of PPOI resolution , Gastrografin did not affect time to resolution of nausea and vomiting ( 64.5 vs 74.3 hours ; P = 0.404 ) or consumption of oral diet ( 75.8 vs 90.0 hours ; P = 0.297 ) . RESULTS	However , it accelerated time to flatus or stool ( 18.9 vs 32.7 hours ; P = 0.047 ) and time to resolution of abdominal distension ( 52.8 vs 77.7 hours ; P = 0.013 ) . RESULTS	There were no significant differences between groups in nasogastric output ; analgesia , antiemetic , or fluid requirement ; complications ; or length of stay . CONCLUSIONS	Gastrografin is not clinically useful in shortening an episode of PPOI characterized by upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms . CONCLUSIONS	It may however be of therapeutic benefit in the subset of PPOI patients who display lower gastrointestinal symptoms exclusively after surgery ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new , transparent composite film dressing , whose adhesive contains chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) , against the native microflora present on human skin . METHODS	CHG-containing adhesive film dressings and non-antimicrobial control film dressings were applied to the skin on the backs of healthy human volunteers without antiseptic preparation . METHODS	Dressings were removed 1 , 4 or 7 days after application . METHODS	The bacterial populations underneath were measured by quantitative cultures ( cylinder-scrub technique ) and compared with one another as a function of time . RESULTS	The mean baseline microflora recovery was 3.24 log10 cfu/cm ( 2 ) . RESULTS	The mean log reductions from baseline measured from underneath the CHG-containing dressings were 0.87 , 0.78 and 1.30 log10 cfu/cm ( 2 ) on days 1 , 4 and 7 , respectively , compared with log reductions of 0.67 , -0.87 and -1.29 log10 cfu/cm ( 2 ) from underneath the control film dressings . RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the log reductions of the two treatments on day 1 , but on days 4 and 7 the log reduction associated with the CHG adhesive was significantly higher than that associated with the control adhesive . CONCLUSIONS	The adhesive containing CHG was associated with a sustained antimicrobial effect that was not present in the control . CONCLUSIONS	Incorporating the antimicrobial into the adhesive layer confers upon it bactericidal properties in marked contrast to the non-antimicrobial adhesive , which contributed to bacterial proliferation when the wear time was 4 days ."
"OBJECTIVE	There is a growing interest for the use of probiotics for chronic constipation . OBJECTIVE	A recent randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) showed a positive effect of Lactobacillus reuteri ( L. reuteri ) on bowel movement frequency in infants with chronic constipation . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of L. reuteri in adult patients with functional constipation . METHODS	A double-blind , placebo RCT was conducted in 40 adults ( 18M/22F , 35 + / -15 years ) affected by functional constipation according to the Rome III criteria . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to receive a supplementation of L. reuteri ( DSM 17938 ) , or matching placebo for 4 weeks . METHODS	The increase of bowel movements/week was the primary outcome , while the improvement of stool consistency was the secondary outcome . RESULTS	At week 4 , the mean increase in bowel movements/week was 2.6 ( SD + / -1.14 , 95 % CI :1.6 -3.6 ) in the L. reuteri group and 1.0 ( SD + / -1.95 % CI :0.12 -1.88 ) in the placebo group ( p = 0.046 ) . RESULTS	At the end of the treatment , the mean bowel movements/week was 5.28 + / -1.93 in the L. reuteri group and 3.89 + / -1.79 in the placebo group . RESULTS	There was a not significant difference in the stool consistency between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	L. reuteri is more effective than the placebo in improving bowel movement frequency in adult patients with functional constipation as previously demonstrated in children , even if it seems to have no effect on stool consistency ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion for the treatment of active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . METHODS	Ninety-two patients were equally and randomly divided into the treatment group and received herb-partitioned moxibustion combined with acupuncture , and the control group received wheat bran-partitioned moxibustion combined with superficial acupuncture . METHODS	The patients received three treatment sessions per week for 12 wk and were followed up for 24 wk . METHODS	The main outcome was evaluated using the CD Activity Index ( CDAI ) score , and the secondary outcomes were evaluated using laboratory indicators such as hemoglobin ( HGB ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , quality-of-life , endoscopic ratings , and intestinal histology scores . RESULTS	The CDAI scores of both the treatment and control groups were significantly reduced after treatment compared with those measured before treatment . RESULTS	However , the degree of improvement in the treatment group was significantly greater than that of the control group . RESULTS	The improvement in symptoms in patients of the treatment group was sustained at follow-up , whereas that of the control group was not . RESULTS	The overall efficacy of the treatment was significantly greater than that of the control . RESULTS	Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in quality-of-life ratings after treatment , but the improvement was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group . RESULTS	In addition , the patients in the treatment group showed significantly increased HGB and significantly decreased CRP levels and histopathological scores at the end of treatment , whereas the control group did not exhibit significant changes . CONCLUSIONS	Moxibustion with acupuncture provided significant therapeutic benefits in patients with active CD beyond the placebo effect and is therefore an effective and safe treatment for active CD ."
"OBJECTIVE	Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre was increased . METHODS	Fibre intake , faecal output of fibre ( measured as non-starch polysaccharide ( NSP ) ) , starch , microbiota and fermentation products , and whole gut transit time ( WGTT ) were assessed in association with habitual diet and when dietary intake of wheat bran ( WB ) - associated fibre and high amylose-associated resistant starch ( RS ) was increased in an 8-week , randomised , single-blind , cross-over study . RESULTS	Despite a tendency to lower habitual fibre intake in UC patients , faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold higher than in controls , whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty acids , pH and WGTT were similar . RESULTS	Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated . RESULTS	In controls ( n = 10 ) , it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion ( p = 0.002 for both ) , had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT ( p = 0.024 ) . RESULTS	In UC patients ( n = 19 ) , high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit , but did not increase the proportion of NSP fermented . RESULTS	Increasing intake of RS/WB had little effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota . RESULTS	However , faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to controls . CONCLUSIONS	Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in patients with UC . CONCLUSIONS	This can not be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not corrected by increasing RS/WB intake , and may be due to abnormal functioning of the gut microbiota .

"OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to compare infants ' gastrointestinal tolerance of formulas supplemented with 2 different levels of galacto-oligosaccharides ( GOS ) versus a control formula ( CF ) or human milk . METHODS	Healthy , full-term infants ( n = 180 ) were enrolled in this 3-group controlled , double-blind , multicenter study , and a concurrently enrolled , nonrandomized human milk-fed group ( HM ) by 8 days of age . METHODS	Infants were randomized to be fed formula supplemented with either 4 g ( EF4 ) or 8 g ( EF8 ) GOS/L or a CF until day of life ( DOL ) 119 . METHODS	Infants were to be seen at DOL 14 , 35 , 56 , 84 , and 119 . METHODS	Parents were to record detailed 24-hour information about intake , tolerance to feedings , and stool patterns and consistency each day from enrollment to DOL 35 , and for 3 days before DOL 56 , 84 , and 119 . METHODS	Stool consistency was scored on a 5-point scale as watery ( 1 ) , loose/mushy , soft , formed , or hard ( 5 ) . RESULTS	The mean stool consistency score was higher in the CF group throughout the study ( CF > EF8 and CF > HM for all study periods and CF > EF4 from DOL 15 to 35 , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was a significantly higher percentage of watery stools in the EF8 versus the CF group from study day 1 ( SD 1 ) to DOL 14 ( P < 0.05 ) , but no differences between the groups in number of stools per day . RESULTS	The percentage of feedings with spit up and/or vomiting within 1 hour after feeding was significantly lower for HM versus EF8 and CF from SD 1 to DOL 14 ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	In this clinical study , milk-based term infant formula ( Similac Advance ) with 4 g GOS/L was well-tolerated in terms of stool consistency and additional measures of gastrointestinal tolerance by newborn infants through the first 4 months of life ."
"OBJECTIVE	To explore the feasibility and safety on lung resection surgery with the combined method of microinjection acupuncture ( MIA ) and intravenous anesthesia instead of compound traditional acupuncture and drug anesthesia ( ADA ) . METHODS	Ninety cases of lung resection surgery were randomized into a general anesthesia group , a MIA group and a ADA group , 30 cases in each one . METHODS	In the general anesthesia group , before surgery , the intramuscular injection of atropine 0.5 mg was used ; during surgery , the anesthesia induction was followed with intravenous injection of fentanyl citrate , propofol and rocuronium bromide and the dosage was increased accordingly ; after surgery , the analgesia pump was applied .

"BACKGROUND	Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel ( LCIG ) is delivered continuously via intrajejunal percutaneous gastrostomy tube . OBJECTIVE	To examine long-term safety , efficacy and quality of life of LCIG in an open-label extension study . METHODS	Patients received 52 weeks of open-label LCIG treatment following a 12-week double-blind , double-dummy trial in which they were randomized to either LCIG or immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa . METHODS	Patient cohort designation was by receipt of LCIG in the preceding trial randomization ( continuing-LCIG vs. LCIG-nave patients ) . RESULTS	Sixty-two of 66 subjects in the double-blind proceeded to the open-label extension . RESULTS	Most subjects ( 95 % ) reported 1 adverse event ( AE ) ; only 3 subjects ( 4.8 % ) discontinued due to AEs . RESULTS	AE incidence declined gradually over 52 weeks . RESULTS	Serious AEs were reported by 23 % . RESULTS	LCIG-nave patients ( N = 29 ) showed a decrease in `` Off '' time and an increase in `` On '' time without troublesome dyskinesia ( change from baseline to final visit in mean [ SD ] hours = -2.34 [ 2.78 ] P < 0.001 and 2.19 [ 3.70 ] P = 0.005 , respectively ) , while continuing-LCIG patients ( N = 33 ) showed sustained `` Off '' time duration and further improvement in `` On '' time without troublesome dyskinesia ( -0.42 [ 2.67 ] P = 0.377 and 1.00 [ 2.58 ] P = 0.036 , respectively ) . RESULTS	The majority of patients in both groups ( LCIG-nave , continuing-LCIG , respectively ) were rated ` Much Improved ' or ` Very Much Improved ' at final visit on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale ( 69.0 % , 69.7 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	Continuing-LCIG patients continued to derive benefit from LCIG while the magnitude of improvement among LCIG-nave patients was similar to that observed for patients on LCIG in the preceding double-blind study . CONCLUSIONS	The overall AE profile was consistent with previous phase 3 clinical trials involving the LCIG system ."
"OBJECTIVE	Ferric citrate hydrate is a novel iron-based phosphate binder being developed for hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD . METHODS	A phase 3 , multicenter , randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled study investigated the efficacy and safety of ferric citrate hydrate in nondialysis-dependent patients with CKD . METHODS	Starting in April of 2011 , 90 CKD patients ( eGFR = 9.215.72 ml/min per 1.73 m ( 2 ) ) with a serum phosphate5 .0 mg/dl were randomized 2:1 to ferric citrate hydrate or placebo for 12 weeks . METHODS	The primary end point was change in serum phosphate from baseline to the end of treatment . METHODS	Secondary end points included the percentage of patients achieving target serum phosphate levels ( 2.5-4 .5 mg/dl ) and change in fibroblast growth factor-23 at the end of treatment . RESULTS	The mean change in serum phosphate was -1.29 mg/dl ( 95 % confidence interval , -1.63 to -0.96 mg/dl ) in the ferric citrate hydrate group and 0.06 mg/dl ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.20 to 0.31 mg/dl ) in the placebo group ( P < 0.001 for difference between groups ) . RESULTS	The percentage of patients achieving target serum phosphate levels was 64.9 % in the ferric citrate hydrate group and 6.9 % in the placebo group ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Fibroblast growth factor-23 concentrations were significantly lower in patients treated with ferric citrate hydrate versus placebo ( change from baseline [ median ] , -142.0 versus 67.0 pg/ml ; P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Ferric citrate hydrate significantly increased serum iron , ferritin , and transferrin saturation compared with placebo ( P = 0.001 or P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Five patients discontinued active treatment because of treatment-emergent adverse events with ferric citrate hydrate treatment versus one patient with placebo . RESULTS	Overall , adverse drug reactions were similar in patients receiving ferric citrate hydrate or placebo , with gastrointestinal disorders occurring in 30.0 % of ferric citrate hydrate patients and 26.7 % of patients receiving placebo . CONCLUSIONS	In patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD , 12-week treatment with ferric citrate hydrate resulted in significant reductions in serum phosphate and fibroblast growth factor-23 while simultaneously increasing serum iron parameters ."
"BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding a high-concentrate corn straw diet on the release of endotoxin in the rumen and the changes of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mammary gland of dairy cows in comparison with a low-concentrate corn straw diet and a low-concentrate mixed forage diet . BACKGROUND	Thirty second-parity Chinese Holstein cows in mid-lactation with a body condition score of 2.860.29 , weighing 54357kg and producing 24.323.86 kg milk per day were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 diets ( n = 10 per treatment ) : 1 ) low-concentrate mixed forage diet ( LCF ) with a concentrate to roughage ratio of 46 : 54 ; 2 ) high-concentrate corn straw diet ( HCS ) with a concentrate to roughage ratio of 65 : 35 ; 3 ) low-concentrate corn straw diet ( LCS ) with the same concentrate to roughage ratio ( 46 : 54 ) as LCF . BACKGROUND	The experiment lasted 6weeks , and samples were collected in the last week . BACKGROUND	Milk samples were analyzed for conventional components , rumen fluid samples were analyzed for pH and endotoxin , and mammary arterial and venous plasma samples were analyzed for concentrations of interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - ) . RESULTS	Concentrations of endotoxin in rumen fluid and feces of cows fed HCS were significantly higher than those of cows fed LCS and LCF . RESULTS	Feeding HCS increased the release of IL-1 , IL-6 and IL-8 in the mammary gland compared with feeding LCS . RESULTS	Concentrations of cytokines ( IL-1 and IL-8 ) in mammary venous plasma had a negative correlation with milk production efficiencies . CONCLUSIONS	Results indicated that the high-concentrate corn straw diet increased the concentrations of endotoxin in rumen fluid and feces . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , feeding the high-concentrate corn straw diet stimulated the mammary gland to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines . CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that feeding a high-concentrate corn straw diet induce a higher pro-inflammatory response in the mammary gland and thus may partly decrease the milk production efficiencies in dairy cows ."
"BACKGROUND	Changes in gut motor and hormonal function contribute to the eating-inhibitory and glucose-lowering effects of protein . BACKGROUND	The effect of amino acids , the digestive products of protein , on gastrointestinal function , eating , and glycemia has not been investigated comprehensively . OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that L-tryptophan ( L-Trp ) stimulates gastrointestinal motor and hormonal functions , inhibits eating , and modulates glycemia . OBJECTIVE	Design , Settings , Participants , and Intervention : Ten healthy , normal-weight men were studied in randomized , double-blind fashion , each receiving a 90-minute intraduodenal infusion of L-Trp at 0.075 ( total 6.75 kcal ) or 0.15 ( total 13.5 kcal ) kcal/min or saline ( control ) . METHODS	Antropyloroduodenal motility , plasma ghrelin , cholecystokinin , glucagon-like peptide-1 , peptide tyrosine tyrosine , insulin , glucagon , blood glucose , and appetite perceptions were measured . METHODS	Food intake was quantified from a buffet meal after the infusion . RESULTS	Intraduodenal L-Trp suppressed antral pressures ( P < .05 ) and stimulated pyloric pressures ( P < .01 ) and markedly increased cholecystokinin and glucagon ( both P < .001 ) . RESULTS	Glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide tyrosine tyrosine increased modestly ( both P < .001 ) , but there was no effect on total ghrelin . RESULTS	Insulin increased slightly ( P < .05 ) without affecting blood glucose . RESULTS	Plasma L-Trp increased substantially ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	All effects were dose-related and associated with increased fullness and substantially decreased energy intake ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	There was a strong inverse correlation between energy intake and plasma L-Trp ( r = -0.70 ; P < .001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Low caloric intraduodenal loads of L-Trp affect gut motor and hormonal function and markedly reduce energy intake . CONCLUSIONS	A strong inverse correlation between energy intake and plasma L-Trp suggests that , beyond gut mechanisms , direct effects of circulating L-Trp mediate its eating-inhibitory effect ."
OBJECTIVE	Analysis of the prevalence of mouth cavity urealytic microflora and determination of the level of its enzymatic activity depending on concentration and amount of urea solution taken as a substrate . METHODS	62 randomly chosen patients at the age of 5-64 took part in the study . METHODS	Each of them rinsed the mouth with 50 ml of 1 % urea solution . METHODS	Before and after rinsing the concentration of ammonia in the mouth cavity air was measured . METHODS	In patients with highest and lowest activity of mouth cavity urealytic microflora a series of tests was carried out including mouth rinsing with urea solution in various concentrations and amounts and measuring ammonia concentration before and after rinsing . METHODS	Obtained results were analyzed using mathematical statistics methods . RESULTS	It was found that in 91 % 1.8 % of randomly chosen patients ( p < 0.05 ) mouth cavity microflora showed apparent urease activity . RESULTS	The lowest concentration ( 0.0625 % in 50 ml ) and volume ( 0.5 ml of 1 % solution ) levels of urea solution were obtained that can exert negative influence on the results of helicobacteriosis diagnosis by means of mouth cavity air analysis . CONCLUSIONS	Urealytic microflora in the mouth cavity is very common and may constitute a factor that decreases the specificity of helicobacteriosis diagnosis by means of the methods based on detection of indicators of gas metabolites resulting from the enzymatic reaction in air samples taken from the mouth cavity after oral administration of urea .
"BACKGROUND	The root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi has been used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of inflammation , fever , cough , dysentery , and hypertension . BACKGROUND	Baicalein is a flavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and is a novel neuroprotective agent under development for the treatment of Parkinsons disease . BACKGROUND	We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties of baicalein and its main metabolite , bacalin , after single-dose administration in healthy Chinese subjects . BACKGROUND	The safety and tolerability of baicalein were also assessed . METHODS	This was a Phase I , randomized , double-blind , single-dose trial of baicalein ( 100-2800 mg ) in 72 healthy adults . METHODS	Samples of blood , urine and feces were collected at regular intervals up to 48 h after administration of the study drug . METHODS	Baicalein and baicalin were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) . METHODS	The maximum concentration that the drug achieved after dosing ( Cmax ) , time to Cmax ( Tmax ) , terminal half-life ( t / ) , area under the curve from time zero to time of last quantifiable concentration ( AUC ( 0 , t ) ) , area under the curve from time zero to infinity ( AUC ( 0 , ) ) , apparent total plasma clearance ( CL/F ) , and apparent total volume of distribution ( V/F ) were determined using non-compartmental models . METHODS	Dose proportion was tested using a method combining the equivalence criterion and power model . METHODS	Physical examinations , vital signs , ECG findings , hematology , and urinalysis were monitored before and at regular intervals after administration of the study drug . RESULTS	The PK profile of baicelein and baicelin was characterized by a median Tmax of 0.75-3 .5 h and 0.5-3 h , respectively , followed by a multiphasic profile with a t / of 1.90-15 .01 h and 4.22-10 .80 h , respectively . RESULTS	The estimates of the proportionality coefficient ( 90 % CI ) for Cmax , AUC-t and AUC - were 0.83 ( 0.70-0 .96 ) , 0.91 ( 0.81-1 .00 ) and 0.92 ( 0.82-1 .02 ) , respectively . RESULTS	All values overlapped within the pre-specified range of ( 0.89-1 .11 ) , ( 0.93-1 .07 ) , and ( 0.93-1 .07 ) , respectively . RESULTS	Dose proportionality was inconclusive for a baicalein dose range of 100-2800 mg . RESULTS	The total urinary clearance of baicalein and baicalin was < 1 % . RESULTS	Approximately 27 % of baicalein was eliminated as unchanged drug in feces . RESULTS	Baicalein was well tolerated . RESULTS	Eleven treatment-related adverse events were observed , and all were rated as `` mild '' and resolved without further treatment . RESULTS	No serious adverse events occurred . CONCLUSIONS	Single oral doses of 100-2800 mg of baicalein were safe and well tolerated by healthy subjects . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical laboratory assessments showed no signs of toxicity in the liver or kidney . CONCLUSIONS	The favorable safety profile and PK properties warrant further clinical studies for baicalein ."
"OBJECTIVE	To observe the therapeutic effect of a drug pair of Radix Astragali and Rehmanniae Radix combined with glucocorticoid ( GC ) in treating lupus nephritis ( LN ) patients and its influence on some experimental indices . METHODS	Totally 52 LN patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group ( treated by routine Western medicine and a drug pair of Radix Astragali and Rehmanniae Radix , 25 cases ) and the control group ( treated by Western medicine , mainly by GC and cyclophosphamide , 27 cases ) . METHODS	All patients received 6-month therapy . METHODS	The GC dosage , the withdrawal and reduction dosage of GC , clinical efficacy , systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index ( SLEDAI ) score , adverse reactions , and laboratory indicators were recorded . RESULTS	( 1 ) All patients got relieved to some degree with the dosage of GC reduced . RESULTS	The total withdrawal and reduction dosage of GC was slightly higher in the treatment group than in the control group [ ( 50.23 + / - 12.43 ) mg vs ( 48.76 + / - 13.61 ) mg , P > 0.05 ] . RESULTS	Besides , the prednisone dosage in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group , but without statistical difference ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The ratio of patients in need of adding prednisone for aggravating disease was 24.0 % , significantly lower than that in the control group ( 44.44 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( 2 ) There was no statistical difference in the SLEDAI score , inflammatory indicators , liver and renal functions , blood electrolytes , blood glucose , blood and urine routines between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The 24-h urinary protein count was ( 1.06 + / - 0.22 ) g/L in the treatment group , obviously lower than that in the control group ( 1.43 + / - 0.55 g/L , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( 3 ) There was no statistical difference in the incidence rate of infection , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , psychoneuroses , Cushing 's syndrome , cardiovascular anomalies , and femoral head necrosis between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	But the incidence of adverse reactions such as insomnia , tidal fever , spontaneous sweat , and obesity was less in the treatment group than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Using a drug pair of Radix Astragali and Rehmanniae Radix combined with GC in treating LN could withdraw the dosage of GC and relieve symptoms it induced . CONCLUSIONS	It was advantageous in reducing the dosage of GC and stabilizing patients ' conditions ."
"BACKGROUND	Transfusion thresholds for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding are controversial . BACKGROUND	So far , only three small , underpowered studies and one single-centre trial have been done . BACKGROUND	Findings from the single-centre trial showed reduced mortality with restrictive red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether a multicentre , cluster randomised trial is a feasible method to substantiate or refute this finding . METHODS	In this pragmatic , open-label , cluster randomised feasibility trial , done in six university hospitals in the UK , we enrolled all patients aged 18 years or older with new presentations of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding , irrespective of comorbidity , except for exsanguinating haemorrhage . METHODS	We randomly assigned hospitals ( 1:1 ) with a computer-generated randomisation sequence ( random permuted block size of 6 , without stratification or matching ) to either a restrictive ( transfusion when haemoglobin concentration fell below 80 g/L ) or liberal ( transfusion when haemoglobin concentration fell below 100 g/L ) RBC transfusion policy . METHODS	Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation . METHODS	Feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate , protocol adherence , haemoglobin concentration , RBC exposure , selection bias , and information to guide design and economic evaluation of the phase 3 trial . METHODS	Main exploratory clinical outcomes were further bleeding and mortality at day 28 . METHODS	We did analyses on all enrolled patients for whom an outcome was available . METHODS	This trial is registered , ISRCTN85757829 and NCT02105532 . RESULTS	Between Sept 3 , 2012 , and March 1 , 2013 , we enrolled 936 patients across six hospitals ( 403 patients in three hospitals with a restrictive policy and 533 patients in three hospitals with a liberal policy ) . RESULTS	Recruitment rate was significantly higher for the liberal than for the restrictive policy ( 62 % vs 55 % ; p = 004 ) . RESULTS	Despite some baseline imbalances , Rockall and Blatchford risk scores were identical between policies . RESULTS	Protocol adherence was 96 % ( SD 10 ) in the restrictive policy vs 83 % ( 25 ) in the liberal policy ( difference 14 % ; 95 % CI 7-21 ; p = 0005 ) . RESULTS	Mean last recorded haemoglobin concentration was 116 ( SD 24 ) g/L for patients on the restrictive policy and 118 ( 20 ) g/L for those on the liberal policy ( difference -20 [ 95 % CI -120 to 70 ] ; p = 050 ) . RESULTS	Fewer patients received RBCs on the restrictive policy than on the liberal policy ( restrictive policy 133 [ 33 % ] vs liberal policy 247 [ 46 % ] ; difference -12 % [ 95 % CI -35 to 11 ] ; p = 023 ) , with fewer RBC units transfused ( mean 12 [ SD 21 ] vs 19 [ 28 ] ; difference -07 [ -16 to 03 ] ; p = 012 ) , although these differences were not significant . RESULTS	We noted no significant difference in clinical outcomes . CONCLUSIONS	A cluster randomised design led to rapid recruitment , high protocol adherence , separation in degree of anaemia between groups , and non-significant reduction in RBC transfusion in the restrictive policy . CONCLUSIONS	A large cluster randomised trial to assess the effectiveness of transfusion strategies for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is both feasible and essential before clinical practice guidelines change to recommend restrictive transfusion for all patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding .

"BACKGROUND	XARTEMIS XR ( formerly MNK-795 ) is a combination oxycodone ( OC ) and acetaminophen ( APAP ) analgesic with both immediate-release and extended-release ( ER ) components ( ER OC/APAP ) . BACKGROUND	The tablets are designed with gastric-retentive ER oral delivery technology that releases the ER component at a controlled rate in the upper gastrointestinal tract . BACKGROUND	Because consumption of food has demonstrated an impact on the pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of some marketed products using gastric-retentive ER oral delivery technology , a characterization of the effects of fed ( high - and low-fat diets ) versus fasted conditions on the PK of ER OC/APAP was performed . METHODS	This Phase I study used an open-label randomized single-dose three-period six-sequence crossover single-center design . METHODS	Healthy adult participants ( n = 48 ) were randomized to receive two tablets of ER OC/APAP under three conditions : following a high-fat meal ; following a low-fat meal ; and fasted . METHODS	Plasma concentration versus time data from predose throughout designated times up to 48 hours postdose was used to estimate the PK parameters of oxycodone and APAP . RESULTS	Thirty-one participants completed all three treatment periods . RESULTS	Both oxycodone and APAP were rapidly absorbed under fasted conditions . RESULTS	Total oxycodone and APAP exposures ( area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve [ AUC ] ) from ER OC/APAP were not significantly affected by food , and minimal changes to maximum observed plasma concentration for oxycodone and APAP were also noted . RESULTS	However , food marginally delayed the time to maximum observed plasma concentration of oxycodone and APAP . RESULTS	There was no indication that tolerability was affected by food . CONCLUSIONS	The findings from this study suggest that ER OC/APAP can be administered with or without food ."
"OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the effect of alvimopan treatment vs placebo on health care utilization and costs related to gastrointestinal recovery in patients treated with radical cystectomy in a randomized , phase 4 clinical trial . METHODS	Resource utilization data were prospectively collected and evaluated by cost consequence analysis . METHODS	Hospital costs were estimated from 2012 Medicare reimbursement rates and medication wholesale acquisition costs . METHODS	Differences in base case mean costs between the study cohorts for total postoperative ileus related costs ( hospital days , study drug , nasogastric tubes , postoperative ileus related concomitant medication and postoperative ileus related readmissions ) and total combined costs ( postoperative ileus related , laboratory , electrocardiograms , nonpostoperative ileus related concomitant medication and nonpostoperative ileus related readmission ) were evaluated by probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a bootstrap approach . RESULTS	Mean hospital stay was 2.63 days shorter for alvimopan than placebo ( meanSD 8.443.05 vs 11.078.23 days , p = 0.005 ) . RESULTS	Use of medications or interventions likely intended to diagnose or manage postoperative ileus was lower for alvimopan than for placebo , eg total parenteral nutrition 10 % vs 25 % ( p = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Postoperative ileus related health care costs were $ 2,340 lower for alvimopan and mean total combined costs were decreased by $ 2,640 per patient for alvimopan vs placebo . RESULTS	Analysis using a 10,000-iteration bootstrap approach showed that the mean difference in postoperative ileus related costs ( p = 0.04 ) but not total combined costs ( p = 0.068 ) was significantly lower for alvimopan than for placebo . CONCLUSIONS	In patients treated with radical cystectomy alvimopan decreased hospitalization cost by reducing the health care services associated with postoperative ileus and decreasing the hospital stay ."
"BACKGROUND	The relationship between the risk of celiac disease and both the age at which gluten is introduced to a child 's diet and a child 's early dietary pattern is unclear . METHODS	We randomly assigned 832 newborns who had a first-degree relative with celiac disease to the introduction of dietary gluten at 6 months ( group A ) or 12 months ( group B ) . METHODS	The HLA genotype was determined at 15 months of age , and serologic screening for celiac disease was evaluated at 15 , 24 , and 36 months and at 5 , 8 , and 10 years . METHODS	Patients with positive serologic findings underwent intestinal biopsies . METHODS	The primary outcome was the prevalence of celiac disease autoimmunity and of overt celiac disease among the children at 5 years of age . RESULTS	Of the 707 participants who remained in the trial at 36 months , 553 had a standard-risk or high-risk HLA genotype and completed the study . RESULTS	At 2 years of age , significantly higher proportions of children in group A than in group B had celiac disease autoimmunity ( 16 % vs. 7 % , P = 0.002 ) and overt celiac disease ( 12 % vs. 5 % , P = 0.01 ) . RESULTS	At 5 years of age , the between-group differences were no longer significant for autoimmunity ( 21 % in group A and 20 % in group B , P = 0.59 ) or overt disease ( 16 % and 16 % , P = 0.78 by the log-rank test ) . RESULTS	At 10 years , the risk of celiac disease autoimmunity was far higher among children with high-risk HLA than among those with standard-risk HLA ( 38 % vs. 19 % , P = 0.001 ) , as was the risk of overt celiac disease ( 26 % vs. 16 % , P = 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Other variables , including breast-feeding , were not associated with the development of celiac disease . CONCLUSIONS	Neither the delayed introduction of gluten nor breast-feeding modified the risk of celiac disease among at-risk infants , although the later introduction of gluten was associated with a delayed onset of disease . CONCLUSIONS	A high-risk HLA genotype was an important predictor of disease .

"OBJECTIVE	Infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30 % of infants in first 3 months of life . OBJECTIVE	Results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements . OBJECTIVE	In a randomised clinical trial , we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention . METHODS	Fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion CFU of : Lactobacillus casei , L.rhamnosus , Streptococcus thermophilus , Bifidobacterium breve , L.acidophilus , B.infantis , L.bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide ( Protexin Healthcare , Somerset , UK ) , or placebo daily for 30 days . METHODS	Parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary . METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the treatment success ( reduction in the daily crying time > 50 % ) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution ( reduction in the daily crying time > 90 % ) . RESULTS	The treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic group ( 82.6 % ) compared with placebo ( 35.7 % ) at day 7 ( P < 0.005 ) . RESULTS	At day30 , treatment success was 87 % and 46 % in synbiotic and placebo group , respectively ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group ( 39 % ) compared with placebo ( 7 % ) at day 7 ( P < 0.03 ) but not at day 30 ( 56 % vs. 36 % , P = 0.24 ) . RESULTS	We encountered no complication related to synbiotic use . CONCLUSIONS	This synbiotic ( a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus FOS ) significantly improved colic symptoms in comparison with placebo ."
"OBJECTIVE	Late-onset sepsis frequently complicates prematurity , contributing to morbidity and mortality . OBJECTIVE	Probiotics may reduce mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) in preterm infants , with unclear effect on late-onset sepsis . OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to determine the effect of administering a specific combination of probiotics to very preterm infants on culture-proven late-onset sepsis . METHODS	A prospective multicenter , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomized trial compared daily administration of a probiotic combination ( Bifidobacterium infantis , Streptococcus thermophilus , and Bifidobacterium lactis , containing 1 10 ( 9 ) total organisms ) with placebo ( maltodextrin ) in infants born before 32 completed weeks ' gestation weighing < 1500 g. METHODS	The primary outcome was at least 1 episode of definite late-onset sepsis . RESULTS	Between October 2007 and November 2011 , 1099 very preterm infants from Australia and New Zealand were randomized . RESULTS	Rates of definite late-onset sepsis ( 16.2 % ) , NEC of Bell stage 2 or more ( 4.4 % ) , and mortality ( 5.1 % ) were low in controls , with high breast milk feeding rates ( 96.9 % ) . RESULTS	No significant difference in definite late-onset sepsis or all-cause mortality was found , but this probiotic combination reduced NEC of Bell stage 2 or more ( 2.0 % versus 4.4 % ; relative risk 0.46 , 95 % confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93 , P = .03 ; number needed to treat 43 , 95 % confidence interval 23 to 333 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The probiotics B infantis , S thermophilus , and B lactis significantly reduced NEC of Bell stage 2 or more in very preterm infants , but not definite late-onset sepsis or mortality . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with this combination of probiotics appears to be safe ."
"OBJECTIVE	The intestine efficiently incorporates and rapidly secretes dietary fat as chylomicrons ( lipoprotein particles comprising triglycerides , phospholipids , cholesterol , and proteins ) that contain the apolipoprotein isoform apoB-48 . OBJECTIVE	The gut can store lipids for many hours after their ingestion , and release them in chylomicrons in response to oral glucose , sham feeding , or unidentified stimuli . OBJECTIVE	The gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 ( GLP-2 ) facilitates intestinal absorption of lipids , but its role in chylomicron secretion in human beings is unknown . METHODS	We performed a randomized , single-blind , cross-over study , with 2 study visits 4 weeks apart , to assess the effects of GLP-2 administration on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein ( TRL ) apoB-48 in 6 healthy men compared with placebo . METHODS	Subjects underwent constant intraduodenal feeding , with a pancreatic clamp and primed constant infusion of deuterated leucine . METHODS	In a separate randomized , single-blind , cross-over validation study , 6 additional healthy men ingested a high-fat meal containing retinyl palmitate and were given either GLP-2 or placebo 7 hours later with measurement of TRL triglyceride , TRL retinyl palmitate , and TRL apoB-48 levels . RESULTS	GLP-2 administration resulted in a rapid ( within 30 minutes ) and transient increase in the concentration of TRL apoB-48 , compared with placebo ( P = .03 ) . RESULTS	Mathematic modeling of stable isotope enrichment and the mass of the TRL apoB-48 suggested that the increase resulted from the release of stored , presynthesized apoB-48 from the gut . RESULTS	In the validation study , administration of GLP-2 at 7 hours after the meal , in the absence of additional food intake , robustly increased levels of TRL triglycerides ( P = .007 ) , TRL retinyl palmitate ( P = .002 ) , and TRL apoB-48 ( P = .04 ) compared with placebo . CONCLUSIONS	Administration of GLP-2 to men causes the release of chylomicrons that comprise previously synthesized and stored apoB-48 and lipids . CONCLUSIONS	This transiently increases TRL apoB-48 levels compared with placebo . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical trials number at www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT 01958775 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Recent studies indicate that perioperative fluid restriction leads to better preserved clinical data as well as reduced complication rates . OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to determine the probable mechanism of fluid restriction influence on the complication rate of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery for malignancy . METHODS	Patients ( n = 174 ) undergoing restricted fluid regimen ( R group ) or standard fluid regimen ( S group ) were included in this prospective , randomized trial over 16 months . METHODS	Fluid distribution was determined by Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer ( BIA ) and the difference between two groups was compared regarding complications and the relationship between complications and fluid distribution changes . RESULTS	The restricted intravenous fluid regimen significantly reduced perioperative intravenous fluid volume . RESULTS	Weight gained in S group and was not significantly changed in R group after surgery , especially in POD2 ( media ; R vs. S ; 61.17 vs. 65.40 kg , p = 0.017 ) . RESULTS	The number of patients with postoperative complications was reduced in R group compared with in S group ( 34.5 % vs. 47.8 % , p = 0.076 ) . RESULTS	Systemic complications were significantly reduced in R group ( t = -5.895 , p = 0.000 ) . RESULTS	Patients with complications had an average of 1.6 complications in R group vs. 2.0 in S group ( t = -1.345 , p = 0.183 ) . RESULTS	The multivariate analysis suggested that perioperative fluid distribution changes were associated with the development of postoperative complications . CONCLUSIONS	Perioperative fluid restriction could effect on fluid distribution and reduce tissue and cellular edema , and further , could reduce postoperative complication rates ."
"OBJECTIVE	Minimal hepatic encephalopathy ( MHE ) implies subtle impairment of cognitive functions in the absence of features of overt encephalopathy . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to determine the prevalence of MHE in patients with liver cirrhosis and to find out the effect of rifaximin , probiotics , and l-ornithine l-aspartate ( LOLA ) individually in reversal of MHE by comparing it with placebo group . METHODS	This study was carried out in two phases . METHODS	Phase I included the recruitment of 250 apparently healthy controls and extraction of normative data utilizing three neuropsychometric tests ( NPTs ) and critical flicker frequency ( CFF ) test . METHODS	Phase II consisted of screening and recruitment of patients of MHE followed by drugs trial . METHODS	A total of 317 cirrhotics were screened ; 111 were excluded and the remaining 206 cirrhotics were screened for MHE using NPTs and/or CFF test . METHODS	Of these , 124 patients with MHE were randomized to receive LOLA ( n = 31 ) , rifaximin ( n = 31 ) , probiotics ( n = 32 ) , for 2 months and were compared with patients who were given placebo ( n = 30 ) . RESULTS	Out of 206 cirrhotics , 124 ( 60.19 % ) had MHE . RESULTS	Among these 124 MHE patients , 87 ( 70.16 % ) patients had CFF < 39Hz , 112 ( 90.32 % ) patients with MHE had two or more abnormal NPTs , and 75 ( 60.48 % ) patients had abnormality on both the CFF values and more than two abnormal NPTs . RESULTS	Intention-to-treat analysis showed the number of patients who improved after giving treatment were 67.7 % ( 21/31 ) , 70.9 % ( 22/31 ) , 50 % ( 16/32 ) , and 30 % ( 9/30 ) for LOLA , rifaximin , probiotics , and placebo , respectively . RESULTS	CFF scores and improvement in psychometric tests after treatment were significantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) for LOLA , rifaximin , and probiotics as compared with placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	Prevalence of MHE is high in patients with cirrhosis of liver . CONCLUSIONS	Rifaximin , LOLA , and probiotics are better than giving placebo in patients with MHE ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the long-term effects of dietary intervention on gastrointestinal symptoms after highly dose-escalated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer , using boost with protons or high-dose-rate brachytherapy . METHODS	Patients were randomized to an intervention group ( n = 64 ) advised to reduce insoluble dietary fiber and lactose intake , or to a standard care group ( n = 66 ) advised to continue their usual diet . METHODS	Gastrointestinal symptoms , other domains of health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) , and dietary intake were evaluated for 24months post-radiotherapy with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 , Gastrointestinal Side Effects Questionnaire , and Food Frequency Questionnaire . METHODS	The effect of the intervention on gastrointestinal symptoms was evaluated using generalized estimating equations . RESULTS	Dietary intervention had no obvious effect on long-term gastrointestinal symptoms or HRQOL . RESULTS	The intervention group markedly reduced their dietary fiber and lactose intake during radiotherapy , but adherence tended to decline over time . RESULTS	The vast majority of long-term gastrointestinal symptoms were reported as ' a little ' , with a noticeable difference from pre-treatment only for unintentional stool leakage , limitations on daily activities , and mucus discharge . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term gastrointestinal symptoms were predominantly mild , and dietary intervention was not superior to a usual diet in preventing these symptoms ."
"BACKGROUND	New oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation were developed to be given in fixed doses without the need for the routine monitoring that has hindered usage and acceptance of vitamin K antagonists . BACKGROUND	A concern has emerged , however , that measurement of drug concentration or anticoagulant activity might be needed to prevent excess drug concentrations , which significantly increase bleeding risk . BACKGROUND	In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial , higher-dose and lower-dose edoxaban were compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation . BACKGROUND	Each regimen incorporated a 50 % dose reduction in patients with clinical features known to increase edoxaban drug exposure . BACKGROUND	We aim to assess whether adjustment of edoxaban dose in this trial prevented excess drug concentration and the risk of bleeding events . METHODS	We analysed data from the randomised , double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial . METHODS	We correlated edoxaban dose , plasma concentration , and anti-Factor Xa ( FXa ) activity and compared efficacy and safety outcomes with warfarin stratified by dose reduction status . METHODS	Patients with atrial fibrillation and at moderate to high risk of stroke were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive warfarin , dose adjusted to an international normalised ratio of 20-30 , higher-dose edoxaban ( 60 mg once daily ) , or lower-dose edoxaban ( 30 mg once daily ) . METHODS	Randomisation was done with use of a central , 24 h , interactive , computerised response system . METHODS	International normalised ratio was measured using an encrypted point-of-care device . METHODS	To maintain masking , sham international normalised ratio values were generated for patients assigned to edoxaban . METHODS	Edoxaban ( or placebo-edoxaban in warfarin group ) doses were halved at randomisation or during the trial if patients had creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min , bodyweight 60 kg or less , or concomitant medication with potent P-glycoprotein interaction . METHODS	Efficacy outcomes included the primary endpoint of all-cause stroke or systemic embolism , ischaemic stroke , and all-cause mortality . METHODS	Safety outcomes included the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding , fatal bleeding , intracranial haemorrhage , and gastrointestinal bleeding . METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00781391 . RESULTS	Between Nov 19 , 2008 and Nov 22 , 2010 , 21105 patients were recruited . RESULTS	Patients who met clinical criteria for dose reduction at randomisation ( n = 5356 ) had higher rates of stroke , bleeding , and death compared with those who did not have a dose reduction ( n = 15749 ) . RESULTS	Edoxaban dose ranged from 15 mg to 60 mg , resulting in a two-fold to three fold gradient of mean trough drug exposure ( 160-485 ng/mL in 6780 patients with data available ) and mean trough anti-FXa activity ( 035-085 IU/mL in 2865 patients ) . RESULTS	Dose reduction decreased mean exposure by 29 % ( from 485 ng/mL [ SD 458 ] to 346 ng/mL [ 309 ] ) and 35 % ( from 245 ng/mL [ 227 ] to 160 ng/mL [ 145 ] ) and mean anti-FXa activity by 25 % ( from 085 IU/mL [ 076 ] to 064 IU/mL [ 054 ] ) and 20 % ( from 044 IU/mL [ 037 ] to 035 IU/mL [ 028 ] ) in the higher-dose and lower-dose regimens , respectively . RESULTS	Despite the lower anti-FXa activity , dose reduction preserved the efficacy of edoxaban compared with warfarin ( stroke or systemic embolic event : higher dose pinteraction = 085 , lower dose pinteraction = 099 ) and provided even greater safety ( major bleeding : higher dose pinteraction 002 , lower dose pinteraction = 0002 ) . CONCLUSIONS	These findings validate the strategy that tailoring of the dose of edoxaban on the basis of clinical factors alone achieves the dual goal of preventing excess drug concentrations and helps to optimise an individual patient 's risk of ischaemic and bleeding events and show that the therapeutic window for edoxaban is narrower for major bleeding than thromboembolism .

"BACKGROUND	Evidence suggests that cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy algorithms improve outcomes after high-risk surgery , but there is some concern that this could promote acute myocardial injury . BACKGROUND	We evaluated the incidence of myocardial injury in a perioperative goal-directed therapy trial . METHODS	Patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery ( n = 723 ) were randomly assigned to cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy ( intervention group ) or usual care as part of the OPTIMISE trial . METHODS	At four participating sites , 288 patients were enrolled in a biomarker substudy . METHODS	Serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I ( TnI ) concentration and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) concentration were measured before and at 24 and 72 h after surgery . RESULTS	Median preoperative TnI and NT-ProBNP concentrations were 4.3 ng litre ( -1 ) and 144 pg ml ( -1 ) , respectively . RESULTS	After surgery , 67 ( 46 % ) patients in the intervention group and 68 ( 48 % ) patients receiving usual care had TnI concentrations above the 99th centile upper reference limit ( P = 0.82 ) . RESULTS	Peak serum TnI concentration was similar in the intervention and usual care groups ( median [ interquartile range ] : 10.0 [ 5.3-21 .5 ] vs 7.8 [ 5.0-21 .8 ] ng litre ( -1 ) ; P = 0.85 ) , and no differences were observed in serum TnI concentrations over 72 h ( repeated-measures anova , P = 0.51 ) . RESULTS	Likewise , there were no differences in peak NT-proBNP concentration between intervention and usual care groups ( 645 [ 362-1169 ] vs 659 [ 381-1028 ] pg ml ( -1 ) ; P = 0.86 ) or in serial NT-proBNP concentrations over 72 h ( P = 0.20 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Myocardial injury is common among patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery . CONCLUSIONS	In this study , the frequency was not affected by cardiac output-guided fluid and low-dose inotropic therapy ."
"OBJECTIVE	Lactoferrin ( LF ) is effective in the prevention of sepsis in very low birth weight ( VLBW ) neonates . OBJECTIVE	T-regulatory cells ( Tregs ) are important subsets of T lymphocytes that control pathogen-specific immune responses and are essential for intestinal immune homoeostasis . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study is to determine whether oral LF at a dosage of 200 mg/d reduces nosocomial sepsis episodes and necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) in premature infants and to evaluate the possible effects of LF on Treg levels . METHODS	In this prospective , placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized trial , infants either VLBW or born before 32 weeks were assigned to receive either placebo ( n = 25 ) , or 200 mg LF ( n = 25 ) daily throughout hospitalization . METHODS	Episodes of culture proven nosocomial sepsis and NEC were recorded . METHODS	The level of FOXP3 + CD4 + CD25hi lymphocytes was studied by flow cytometry at birth and discharge . METHODS	A third comparison was made with healthy term neonates ( n = 16 ) . RESULTS	Fewer sepsis episodes were observed in LF-treated infants ( 4.4 vs. 17.3 / 1,000 patient days , p = 0.007 ) with none developing NEC , without statistical significance . RESULTS	Treg levels at birth and discharge were similar , while preterm infants showed significantly lower levels than term controls . RESULTS	However , individual increases in Treg levels were higher in the LF group . CONCLUSIONS	LF prophylaxis reduced nosocomial sepsis episodes . CONCLUSIONS	Treg levels in preterm infants were lower than in term infants and an increase of Treg levels under LF prophylaxis was observed . CONCLUSIONS	Increase in Treg levels can be the mechanism for protective effects of LF on nosocomial sepsis ."
"BACKGROUND	Vitamin A supplementation significantly reduces all-cause mortality when given between 6-59 months of age , but has a null or detrimental effect when given between 1-5 months . BACKGROUND	Studies of neonatal vitamin A supplementation conducted across Africa and South Asia have produced conflicting findings . BACKGROUND	These age-pattern variations might result from immunological interactions between vitamin A supplementation and vaccines . BACKGROUND	Knowledge on the potential immunological sequelae of human neonatal vitamin A supplementation is so scarce that the foremost aim of this study is to seek indicative data on aspects of immunity likely to be affected by neonatal vitamin A supplementation . BACKGROUND	The objective of this trial is to test whether human neonatal vitamin A supplementation modulates immune function including improved thymic maturation in infancy and improved systemic immune responses to routine immunization . METHODS	In an area of moderate vitamin A deficiency in a peri-urban area of The Gambia , 200 mother-infant pairs were enrolled in a double-blind randomised controlled trial . METHODS	Within 48 hours of birth , neonates were randomised with stratification by birth weight and sex to receive either an oral dose of 50,000 IU vitamin A or placebo . METHODS	Expanded Programme of Immunisation birth vaccinations were administered after supplementation , with subsequent vaccinations administered at 8 , 12 and 16 weeks of age . METHODS	A range of immunological outcomes were examined up to 17 weeks of age , with additional morbidity and anthropometry follow-up carried out throughout the first year of life . METHODS	The primary endpoint of this trial is the frequency of circulating T regulatory ( Treg ) cells expressing gut homing receptors in infants at 17 week post-supplementation , with secondary outcomes including thymus maturation and B cell immune responses . CONCLUSIONS	Indicative immunological data from this trial ( and its Bangladeshi counterpart ) , will complement the larger randomised controlled trials ( conducted in India , Tanzania and Ghana ) , on the effectiveness and safety of neonatal vitamin A supplementation in improving infant survival . CONCLUSIONS	Combined these trials , in addition to the existing trials , will inform policy . BACKGROUND	clinicaltrials.gov NCT01476358 ."
"BACKGROUND	Prenatal calcium and iron supplements are recommended in settings of low dietary calcium intake and high prevalence of anemia . BACKGROUND	However , calcium administration may inhibit iron absorption . BACKGROUND	To overcome calcium-iron interactions , we developed a multi-micronutrient powder containing iron ( 60 mg ) , folic acid ( 400 g ) , and calcium carbonate granules microencapsulated with a pH-sensitive enteric coating to delay intestinal release . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to establish in vivo evidence that enteric-coated ( EC ) calcium is bioavailable in pregnant women and to explore the dose-responsiveness of fractional calcium absorption ( FCA ) in pregnancy . METHODS	This was a randomized crossover trial in pregnant women ( 26-28 wk of gestation ) in Dhaka , Bangladesh . METHODS	Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 dose groups ( 500 , 1000 , or 1500 mg elemental Ca ) . METHODS	FCA was estimated in random order for EC and non-EC ( control ) granules by a dual-stable-isotope method ( ( 44 ) Ca-labeled granules and intravenous ( 42 ) Ca ) on the basis of the relative recovery of ( 44 ) Ca compared with ( 42 ) Ca in urine over 48 h. RESULTS	Forty-nine participants with FCA for both EC and non-EC granules were included in the primary analyses . RESULTS	FCA geometric means were as follows : 21.8 % ( 500 mg ) , 9.2 % ( 1000 mg ) , and 11.7 % ( 1500 mg ) for non-EC granules compared with 3.3 % ( 500 mg ) , 1.2 % ( 1000 mg ) , and 2.1 % for EC granules . RESULTS	Cumulative 48-h FCA of EC calcium was 85 % lower ( P < 0.001 ) than that of non-EC calcium , after adjustment for dose . RESULTS	In comparison to 500 mg , the FCA for the 1000-mg dose was 61 % lower ( P < 0.001 ) and was 42 % lower ( P = 0.002 ) for the 1500-mg dose , after adjustment for formulation . CONCLUSIONS	A pH-sensitive enteric coating substantially reduced calcium absorption from a prenatal multi-micronutrient powder . CONCLUSIONS	In its current formulation , this novel supplement is not suitable for clinical use . CONCLUSIONS	FCA was highly dose-dependent , such that doses of 1000 and 1500 mg delivered only negligibly more bioavailable calcium than the 500-mg dose . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01678079 ."
"BACKGROUND	Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency that causes substantial mortality worldwide . BACKGROUND	Acute upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for about 75,000 hospital admissions each year in the UK and causes the death of about 10 % of these patients . BACKGROUND	Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusion in surgical patients and to reduce mortality in bleeding trauma patients , with no apparent increase in thromboembolic events . BACKGROUND	A systematic review of clinical trials of upper gastrointestinal bleeding shows a reduction in the risk of death with tranexamic acid but the quality of the trials was poor and the estimates are imprecise . BACKGROUND	The trials were also too small to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on thromboembolic events . METHODS	HALT-IT is a pragmatic , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial which will determine the effect of tranexamic acid on mortality , morbidity ( re-bleeding , non-fatal vascular events ) , blood transfusion , surgical intervention , and health status in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding . METHODS	Eight thousand adult patients who fulfil the eligibility criteria will be randomised to receive tranexamic acid or placebo . METHODS	Adults with significant acute upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding can be included if the responsible doctor is substantially uncertain as to whether or not to use tranexamic acid in that particular patient . METHODS	Trial treatment consists of a loading dose of tranexamic acid ( 1 g by intravenous injection ) or placebo ( sodium chloride 0.9 % ) given as soon as possible after randomisation , followed by an intravenous infusion of 3 g tranexamic acid or placebo ( sodium chloride 0.9 % ) over 24 hours . METHODS	The main analyses will compare those allocated tranexamic acid with those allocated placebo , on an intention-to-treat basis . METHODS	Results will be presented as effect estimates with a measure of precision ( 95 % confidence intervals ) . METHODS	Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome will be based on time to treatment , source of bleeding ( upper versus lower ) , suspected variceal bleeding and severity of bleeding . METHODS	A study with 8,000 patients will have over 90 % power to detect a 25 % reduction in mortality from 10 % to 7.5 % .

"OBJECTIVE	Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) is a common condition associated with symptoms as heart burn , regurgitation , chest pain , and gastrointestinal discomfort . OBJECTIVE	PPC-5650 is a new pharmacological agent that can modulate acid-sensing ion channel activity , potentially leading to reduction in the pain signal . OBJECTIVE	In healthy volunteers the esophagus was sensitized with acid to mimic GERD with the aims : 1 ) to assess the efficacy of a single bolus of PPC-5650 locally applied to the esophagus using multimodal pain stimulations , and 2 ) to assess the safety profile of PPC-5650 . METHODS	The study was a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , crossover trial in healthy males . METHODS	Esophageal electrical , thermal , mechanical , and chemical stimulations were performed , pain perception was rated , and referred pain areas were drawn . METHODS	Sensitization was induced by intraluminal esophageal acid perfusions . METHODS	Adverse events were registered . RESULTS	Twenty-five healthy males completed the study ( mean age 23.4 2.0 years ) . RESULTS	About 90 min after drug administration , PPC-5650 increased the volume tolerated at moderate pain during mechanical stimulation compared to placebo ( difference 13.5 , 95 % CI : 0.58-26 .47 , p = 0.04 ) , but there was no effects on thermal - , electrical - , and chemical-induced pain ( all p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	PPC-5650 did not affect referred pain areas to any stimulation ( all p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Ten participants reported adverse events during the placebo treatment period , and nine participants reported adverse events during the PPC-5650 treatment period ( p = 0.8 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Sensitization to mechanical stimulation of the esophagus was reduced by PPC-5650 compared to placebo . CONCLUSIONS	The overall safety and tolerability of PPC-5650 was acceptable . CONCLUSIONS	Thus , PPC-5650 may play a role in the future treatment of patients with GERD ."
"OBJECTIVE	To examine the efficacy and safety of otilonium bromide ( OB ) in treatment-sensitive functional irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) clinical parameters . METHODS	Ninety-three patients ( 44.8 12.6 years , 69 % female ) with IBS symptoms complying with Rome II criteria participated in this double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised , dose-ranging phase I/II study . METHODS	Patients were administered OB 20 mg ( n = 24 ) , 40 mg ( n = 23 ) and 80 mg ( n = 23 ) tid or placebo ( n = 23 ) in 4 parallel groups for 4 wk . METHODS	Primary efficacy variables included abdominal discomfort , intestinal habits , number of daily evacuations and stool consistency . METHODS	Secondary efficacy measures included return to regular intestinal habits and global discomfort . METHODS	Safety was also assessed . RESULTS	Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the 4 groups . RESULTS	Although individual parameters such as intensity and frequency of abdominal discomfort , bloating or pain were reduced by OB over the 4 wk , no significant differences were observed between groups . RESULTS	Similarly , no difference was observed between OB treatment or placebo for mucus in stool and incomplete or difficulty of evacuation . RESULTS	However , evacuation frequency was significantly reduced after 4 wk by 80 mg OB compared to placebo ( -8.36 % for placebo vs -41.9 % for 80 mg OB , P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	While 21.7 % of patients in the placebo group experienced regular intestinal habits after 4 wk , this improvement was greater for patients treated with 40 mg OB ( P < 0.01 vs placebo ) . RESULTS	Furthermore , a dose-dependent reduction in frequency of diarrhoea ( ( 2 ) - test for trend = 11.5 , P < 0.001 ) and an increase in normal stool frequency was observed . RESULTS	Combining individual variables into a global discomfort index revealed significant improvement among increasing OB doses , favouring 40 mg ( P = 0.013 ) and 80 mg OB ( P = 0.001 ) over placebo . RESULTS	No difference was observed between frequency of adverse events for placebo vs OB . CONCLUSIONS	This dose-ranging study demonstrates that OB at 40 and 80 mg can improve individual and global clinical symptoms of IBS compared to placebo over a 4-wk period ."
"BACKGROUND	The efficacy and safety of axitinib , a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 , 2 , and 3 in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin was evaluated in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . METHODS	Overall , 170 patients were randomly assigned to receive axitinib at a starting dose of 5-mg twice daily continuously plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m ( 2 ) and cisplatin 75 mg/m ( 2 ) on day 1 of up to six 21-day cycles ( arm I ) ; axitinib on days 2 through 19 of each cycle plus pemetrexed/cisplatin ( arm II ) ; or pemetrexed/cisplatin alone ( arm III ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS ) . RESULTS	Median PFS was 8.0 , 7.9 , and 7.1 months in arms I , II , and III , respectively ( hazard ratio : arms I vs. III , 0.89 [ P = 0.36 ] and arms II vs. III , 1.02 [ P = 0.54 ] ) . RESULTS	Median overall survival was 17.0 months ( arm I ) , 14.7 months ( arm II ) , and 15.9 months ( arm III ) . RESULTS	Objective response rates ( ORRs ) for axitinib-containing arms were 45.5 % ( arm I ) and 39.7 % ( arm II ) compared with 26.3 % for pemetrexed/cisplatin alone ( arm III ) . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal disorders and fatigue were frequently reported across all treatment arms . RESULTS	The most common all-causality grade 3 adverse events were hypertension in axitinib-containing arms ( 20 % and 17 % , arms I and II , respectively ) and fatigue with pemetrexed/cisplatin alone ( 16 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	Axitinib in combination with pemetrexed/cisplatin was generally well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	Axitinib combinations resulted in non-significant differences in PFS and numerically higher ORR compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced NSCLC .

"BACKGROUND	Advanced glycation endproducts ( AGEs ) contribute to the development of vascular complications of diabetes and have been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes . BACKGROUND	Since AGEs are generated within foodstuffs upon food processing , it is increasingly recognised that the modern diet is replete with AGEs . BACKGROUND	AGEs are thought to stimulate chronic low-grade inflammation and promote oxidative stress and have been linked to the development of insulin resistance . BACKGROUND	Simple therapeutic strategies targeted at attenuating the progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance are urgently required to prevent or slow the development of type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals . BACKGROUND	Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota has been shown to confer a number of health benefits to the host , but its effect on advanced glycation is unknown . BACKGROUND	The aim of this article is to describe the methodology of a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised crossover trial designed to determine the effect of 12week consumption of a prebiotic dietary supplement on the advanced glycation pathway , insulin sensitivity and chronic low-grade inflammation in adults with pre-diabetes . METHODS	Thirty adults with pre-diabetes ( Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Impaired Fasting Glucose ) aged between 40-60 years will be randomly assigned to receive either 10 grams of prebiotic ( inulin/oligofructose ) daily or 10 grams placebo ( maltodextrin ) daily for 12weeks . METHODS	After a 2-week washout period , study subjects will crossover to receive the alternative dietary treatment for 12weeks . METHODS	The primary outcome is the difference in markers of the advanced glycation pathway carboxymethyllysine ( CML ) and methylglyoxal ( MG ) between experimental and control treatments . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include HbA1c , insulin sensitivity , lipid levels , blood pressure , serum glutathione , adiponectin , IL-6 , E-selectin , myeloperoxidase , C-reactive protein , Toll-like Receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , soluble receptor for AGE ( sRAGE ) , urinary 8-isoprostanes , faecal bacterial composition and short chain fatty acid profile . METHODS	Anthropometric measures including BMI and waist circumference will be collected in addition to comprehensive dietary and lifestyle data . CONCLUSIONS	Prebiotics which selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the human colon might offer protection against AGE-related pathology in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes .

"BACKGROUND	Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) is a leading cause of diarrhoea in health care settings with symptoms ranging from mild and self-limiting to life threatening . BACKGROUND	SMT19969 is a novel , non-absorbable antibiotic currently under development for the treatment of CDI . BACKGROUND	Here we report the results from a Phase I study . METHODS	A double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study assessing safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of SMT19969 in healthy volunteers . METHODS	Pharmacokinetic assessments included blood and faecal sampling . METHODS	The effect of food on systemic exposure and analysis of the gut microbiota were also included . RESULTS	Fifty-six healthy male subjects were enrolled . RESULTS	Following single oral doses of up to 2,000 mg in the fasted state , plasma concentrations of SMT19969 were generally below the lower limit of quantification . RESULTS	In the fed state levels ranged from 0.102 to 0.296 ng/mL after single dosing and after repeat dosing at Day 10 from 0.105 to 0.305 ng/mL . RESULTS	Following single and multiple oral doses of SMT19969 , mean daily faecal concentrations increased with increasing dose level and were significantly above the typical MIC range for C. difficile ( 0.06-0 .5 g/mL ) . RESULTS	At 200 mg BID , mean ( SD ) faecal concentrations of 1,466 ( 547 ) g/g and 1,364 ( 446 ) g/g were determined on days 5 and 10 of dosing respectively . RESULTS	No notable metabolites were detected in faeces . RESULTS	Overall , all doses of SMT19969 were well tolerated both as single oral doses or BID oral doses for 10 days . RESULTS	The majority ( 88 % ) of adverse events ( AEs ) were classified as gastrointestinal disorders and were mild in severity , resolving without treatment . RESULTS	The gut microbiota was analysed in the multiple dose groups with minimal changes observed in the bacterial groups analysed except for total clostridia which were reduced to below the limit of detection by day 4 of dosing . CONCLUSIONS	Oral administration of SMT19969 was considered safe and well tolerated and was associated with negligible plasma concentrations after single and multiple doses . CONCLUSIONS	In addition , minimal disruption of normal gut microbiota was noted , confirming the highly selective spectrum of the compound . CONCLUSIONS	These results support the further clinical development of SMT19969 as an oral therapy for CDI . BACKGROUND	Current Controlled Trials . BACKGROUND	ISRCTN10858225 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Probiotics help maintain balance in composition of the gut microbiota , and have been considered as a potential treatment for obesity . OBJECTIVE	This study was conducted in order to assess the effects of probiotics when combined with herbal medicine in treatment of obesity . OBJECTIVE	Probiotics were tested for the ability to modulate gut microbiota , gut permeability , and endotoxin level , which may have correlation with factors involved in obesity . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled study was conducted , in which patients with higher BMI ( > 25kg/m ( 2 ) ) and waist circumference ( > 85cm ) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive Bofutsushosan with either probiotics or placebo capsules for a period of eight weeks . METHODS	Assessment of body composition parameters , metabolic biomarkers , endotoxin level , gut permeability , and fecal bacteria in stool was performed at baseline and at week 8 . METHODS	The study was registered at the Clinical Research Information Service , approved by the Korea National Institute of Health ( KCT0000386 ) . RESULTS	Although both groups showed a significant reduction in weight and waist circumference ( p = 0.000 ) , no significant differences in body composition and metabolic markers were observed . RESULTS	In correlation analysis , change in body composition showed positive correlation with endotoxin level ( r = 0.441 , p < 0.05 for BW ; and r = 0.350 , p < 0.05 for fat mass ) and the population of gut Lactobacillus plantarum ( r = 0.425 , p < 0.05 for BW ; and r = 0.407 , p < 0.05 for BMI ) . RESULTS	The Gram negative bacterial population in gut also exhibited positive correlation with changes in body composition ( WC ) and total cholesterol level ( r = 0.359 , and 0.393 , for the former and later parameters , respectively , p < 0.05 for both ) . RESULTS	While , the profile of gut Bifidobacterium breve population showed negative correlation with endotoxin level ( r = -0.350 , p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Correlations between gut microbiota and change in body composition indicate that probiotics may influence energy metabolism in obesity . CONCLUSIONS	Correlation between endotoxin level and weight reduction indicates that probiotics may play an important role in prevention of endotoxin production , which can lead to gut microbiota dysbiosis associated with obesity ."

"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the safety of the fixed combination of ibuprofen and famotidine compared with ibuprofen alone from two 24-week , multicenter , double-blind trials designed to evaluate the comparative incidence of endoscopically documented upper gastrointestinal ulcers and a 28-week double-blind extension study . METHODS	Safety was analyzed by pooling data from the two double-blind trials and the follow-on study . METHODS	Safety was assessed by monitoring the incidence , causality , and severity of adverse events ( AEs ) . RESULTS	In the pivotal efficacy and safety trials , discontinuation rates due to any cause and dyspepsia were significantly lower for the ibuprofen/famotidine combination versus ibuprofen alone . RESULTS	Other than dyspepsia , gastrointestinal and cardiovascular AEs of special interest were similar . RESULTS	Events judged to be treatment related were significantly lower with the ibuprofen/famotidine combination ( 20.6 % vs. 25 % ) . RESULTS	In the safety extension population , there were no differences in the discontinuation rates and the reporting of AEs or serious AEs ( SAEs ) between the two groups . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal-related events were similar between the groups . RESULTS	Incidence of cardiovascular-related AEs of special interest were 11 % ( ibuprofen/famotidine ) and 2 % ( ibuprofen ) ( p = 0.06 ) , possibly due to a higher number of rheumatoid arthritis patients in the combination group . RESULTS	Of these , 80 % were reports of hypertension ( 8 % ibuprofen/famotidine vs. 2 % ibuprofen ) . RESULTS	Three cases of hypertension in the ibuprofen/famotidine group were considered treatment related . RESULTS	The probability of a cardiovascular event decreased during days 112-167 of treatment and remained low with continued treatment . CONCLUSIONS	One-year safety data from two pivotal trials and a long-term extension study indicate that the ibuprofen/famotidine combination demonstrates a favorable gastrointestinal safety profile and more patients continued on therapy compared to ibuprofen alone . CONCLUSIONS	No new safety signals have been identified . CONCLUSIONS	These data offer additional evidence supporting a new therapeutic option to improve gastrointestinal safety and adherence for patients who require long-term ibuprofen ."
"OBJECTIVE	To examine the comparative antidepressant efficacy of S-adenosyl-L-methionine ( SAMe ) and escitalopram in a placebo-controlled , randomized , double-blind clinical trial . METHODS	One hundred eighty-nine outpatients ( 49.7 % female , mean [ SD ] age = 45 [ 15 ] years ) with DSM-IV-diagnosed major depressive disorder ( MDD ) were recruited from April 13 , 2005 , to December 22 , 2009 , at the Massachusetts General Hospital and at Butler Hospital . METHODS	Patients were randomized for 12 weeks to SAMe 1,600-3 ,200 mg/d , escitalopram 10-20 mg/d , or placebo . METHODS	Doses were escalated at 6 weeks in the event of nonresponse . METHODS	The main outcome measure was the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-17 ) . METHODS	Tolerability was assessed by the Systematic Assessment for Treatment of Emergent Events-Specific Inquiry ( SAFTEE-SI ) . RESULTS	All 3 treatment arms demonstrated a significant improvement of about 5-6 points in HDRS-17 scores ( P < .001 for all ) , and no significant differences were observed between the treatment arms ( P > .05 for all ) . RESULTS	Response rates in the intent-to-treat sample were 36 % for SAMe , 34 % for escitalopram , and 30 % for placebo . RESULTS	Remission rates were 28 % for SAMe , 28 % for escitalopram , and 17 % for placebo . RESULTS	No comparisons between treatment groups attained significance ( P > .05 for all ) . RESULTS	Tolerability was good , with gastrointestinal side effects ( 19 % for stomach discomfort and 20 % for diarrhea ) as the most common in the SAMe arm . RESULTS	Significant differences were observed between treatment groups for dizziness , anorgasmia , diminished mental acuity , and hot flashes ( P < .05 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS	The results fail to support an advantage over placebo for either the investigational treatment SAMe or the standard treatment escitalopram for MDD .

"OBJECTIVE	To study the effects of extensively hydrolyzed protein formula ( eHF ) on the feeding and growth in preterm infants through a multicenter controlled clinical study . METHODS	Preterm infants admitted to eight upper first-class hospitals in China between February 2012 and December 2013 were randomly selected . METHODS	They were divided into two observation groups and two control groups . METHODS	The first observation group consisted of preterm infants with a gestational age of < 32 weeks , who were fed with eHF for 10-14 days after birth and then with standard preterm formula ( SPF ) until discharge . METHODS	The second observation group consisted of preterm infants with a gestational age of 32-34 weeks , who were fed with SPF after birth , but were switched to eHF ( 7-14 days ) if suffering feeding intolerance at 6-8 days after birth . METHODS	The two control groups with corresponding gestational ages kept to be fed with SPF after birth . METHODS	Clinical data were recorded to compare feeding condition , physical growth , blood biochemical indices , and major complications between different groups . RESULTS	A total of 328 preterm infants were enrolled . RESULTS	Preterm infants with a gestational age of < 32 weeks in the observation group had a significantly shorter meconium evacuation time than in the corresponding control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	They also had significantly lower levels of serum total bilirubin at weeks 1 and 2 after birth compared with the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The observation group needed more time in reaching enteral nutrition ( EN ) basic energy uptake of 50 kcal / ( kgd ) , partial parenteral nutrition ( PPN ) , hospitalization , and corrected gestational age at discharge compared with the controlled infants ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no difference in the incidence of extrauterine growth retardation ( EUGR ) at discharge between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Preterm infants with a gestational age of 32-34 weeks in the observation group had significantly lower serum total bilirubin levels at 2 weeks after birth compared with the corresponding control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	They required more time in achieving EN basic energy and PPN than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no difference in the incidence of EUGR at discharge between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	For preterm infants , eHF can improve gastrointestinal motility , accelerate bilirubin metabolism and excretion and does not increase the incidence of EUGR ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the long-term safety of the single-tablet combination of ibuprofen 800mg and famotidine 26.6 mg . METHODS	A phase 3b open-label study ( NCT00984815 ) was conducted in 86 adults requiring daily non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) administration for 12 months . METHODS	The combination tablet of ibuprofen/famotidine was self-administered orally three times daily for up to 54 consecutive weeks . METHODS	Adverse events ( AEs ) were collected beginning at the first dose and continued through completion ( 54 weeks ) . METHODS	The Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment ( SODA ) questionnaire was completed by patients to assess tolerability . RESULTS	Most patients ( 65 % ) finished the trial , with 76 % contributing data at 6 months , and 21 % withdrew due to adverse effects . RESULTS	Overall and gastrointestinal AE discontinuation rates ( 21 % and 13 % , respectively ) were lower than that previously reported with ibuprofen 2400mg given alone . RESULTS	Each of the SODA subscale scores demonstrated improvement by week 6 and improved statistically significantly at week 24 and week 54 . RESULTS	Of the cardiovascular AEs , hypertension was reported most frequently ( 9/86 , 9.3 % ) , with 3.5 % determined to be drug related . RESULTS	Twelve serious AEs were reported by 9 of 86 ( 10 % ) patients ; two were considered possibly related to the study medication ( unstable angina and gastric ulcer ) . RESULTS	There were no reports of serious gastrointestinal or CV complications . RESULTS	Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and not considered drug related . CONCLUSIONS	These data , together with previously reported findings of a significant decrease in upper gastrointestinal endoscopic ulcer rate at 6 months , support the overall safety , compliance , and tolerability of this single-tablet formulation ."
"BACKGROUND	Radical cystectomy ( RC ) for bladder cancer is frequently associated with delayed gastrointestinal ( GI ) recovery that prolongs hospital length of stay ( LOS ) . OBJECTIVE	To assess the efficacy of alvimopan to accelerate GI recovery after RC . METHODS	We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients undergoing RC and receiving postoperative intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesics . METHODS	Oral alvimopan 12 mg ( maximum : 15 inpatient doses ) versus placebo . METHODS	The two-component primary end point was time to upper ( first tolerance of solid food ) and lower ( first bowel movement ) GI recovery ( GI-2 ) . METHODS	Time to discharge order written , postoperative LOS , postoperative ileus ( POI ) - related morbidity , opioid consumption , and adverse events ( AEs ) were evaluated . METHODS	An independent adjudication of cardiovascular AEs was performed . CONCLUSIONS	Patients were randomized to alvimopan ( n = 143 ) or placebo ( n = 137 ) ; 277 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat population . CONCLUSIONS	The alvimopan cohort experienced quicker GI-2 recovery ( 5.5 vs 6.8 d ; hazard ratio : 1.8 ; p < 0.0001 ) , shorter mean LOS ( 7.4 vs 10.1 d ; p = 0.0051 ) , and fewer episodes of POI-related morbidity ( 8.4 % vs 29.1 % ; p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The incidence of opioid consumption and AEs or serious AEs ( SAEs ) was comparable except for POI , which was lower in the alvimopan group ( AEs : 7 % vs 26 % ; SAEs : 5 % vs 20 % , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	Cardiovascular AEs occurred in 8.4 % ( alvimopan ) and 15.3 % ( placebo ) of patients ( p = 0.09 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Generalizability may be limited due to the exclusion of epidural analgesia and the inclusion of mostly high-volume centers utilizing open laparotomy . CONCLUSIONS	Alvimopan is a useful addition to a standardized care pathway in patients undergoing RC by accelerating GI recovery and shortening LOS , with a safety profile similar to placebo . RESULTS	This study examined the effects of alvimopan on bowel recovery in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer . RESULTS	Patients receiving alvimopan experienced quicker bowel recovery and had a shorter hospital stay compared with those who received placebo , with comparable safety .

"BACKGROUND	Transenteral ( TE ) administration of a bowel cleanser prior to colonoscopy avoids the discomfort associated with drinking a large volume of unpalatable cleanser . OBJECTIVE	To explore patient comfort , preference for future colonoscopy , the efficacy and adverse events associated with TE bowel preparation . METHODS	Bowel preparation is traditionally practised using polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) + ascorbic acid ( ASC ) , which was the treatment used in the control group ( peroral group ; PO group ) . METHODS	In the study group ( TE group ) , PEG + ASC were administered directly to the third portion of the duodenum through a scope immediately after completing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . RESULTS	A higher proportion of subjects in the TE group graded their degree of comfort as very or rather comfortable ( 28.4 % in the PO group , 65.1 % in the TE group ; p = 0.000 ) and had greater preference for future colonoscopy ( 69.6 % in the PO group , 82.5 % in the TE group ; p = 0.030 ) , compared with the PO group . RESULTS	The TE group had non-inferiority in efficacy compared with the PO group ( non-inferiority margin -15 % ; lower limit of 95 % confidence interval for difference between success rates -6.4 % , when using the Aronchick Scale , and -7.1 % when using the Ottawa Scale ) . RESULTS	Nausea or vomiting were more prevalent during preparation in the PO group ( 46.1 vs. 17.5 % ; p = 0.000 ) , and dizziness was more common in the TE group ( 0 vs. 12.6 % ; p = 0.000 ) . CONCLUSIONS	TE preparation was found to be more comfortable than the traditional peroral method and not inferior in efficacy . CONCLUSIONS	The adverse events rate was acceptable ."
"OBJECTIVE	Invasive candidiasis in premature infants causes death and neurodevelopmental impairment . OBJECTIVE	Fluconazole prophylaxis reduces candidiasis , but its effect on mortality and the safety of fluconazole are unknown . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluconazole in preventing death or invasive candidiasis in extremely low-birth-weight infants . METHODS	This study was a randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled trial of fluconazole in premature infants . METHODS	Infants weighing less than 750 g at birth ( N = 361 ) from 32 neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs ) in the United States were randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole or placebo twice weekly for 42 days . METHODS	Surviving infants were evaluated at 18 to 22 months corrected age for neurodevelopmental outcomes . METHODS	The study was conducted between November 2008 and February 2013 . METHODS	Fluconazole ( 6 mg/kg of body weight ) or placebo . METHODS	The primary end point was a composite of death or definite or probable invasive candidiasis prior to study day 49 ( 1 week after completion of study drug ) . METHODS	Secondary and safety outcomes included invasive candidiasis , liver function , bacterial infection , length of stay , intracranial hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia , chronic lung disease , patent ductus arteriosus requiring surgery , retinopathy of prematurity requiring surgery , necrotizing enterocolitis , spontaneous intestinal perforation , and neurodevelopmental outcomes-defined as a Bayley-III cognition composite score of less than 70 , blindness , deafness , or cerebral palsy at 18 to 22 months corrected age . RESULTS	Among infants receiving fluconazole , the composite primary end point of death or invasive candidiasis was 16 % ( 95 % CI , 11 % -22 % ) vs 21 % in the placebo group ( 95 % CI , 15 % -28 % ; odds ratio , 0.73 [ 95 % CI , 0.43-1 .23 ] ; P = .24 ; treatment difference , -5 % [ 95 % CI , -13 % to 3 % ] ) . RESULTS	Invasive candidiasis occurred less frequently in the fluconazole group ( 3 % [ 95 % CI , 1 % -6 % ] ) vs the placebo group ( 9 % [ 95 % CI , 5 % -14 % ] ; P = .02 ; treatment difference , -6 % [ 95 % CI , -11 % to -1 % ] ) . RESULTS	The cumulative incidences of other secondary outcomes were not statistically different between groups . RESULTS	Neurodevelopmental impairment did not differ between the groups ( fluconazole , 31 % [ 95 % CI , 21 % -41 % ] vs placebo , 27 % [ 95 % CI , 18 % -37 % ] ; P = .60 ; treatment difference , 4 % [ 95 % CI , -10 % to 17 % ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	Among infants with a birth weight of less than 750 g , 42 days of fluconazole prophylaxis compared with placebo did not result in a lower incidence of the composite of death or invasive candidiasis . CONCLUSIONS	These findings do not support the universal use of prophylactic fluconazole in extremely low-birth-weight infants . BACKGROUND	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00734539 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Despite increasing trends toward the early initiation of oral feeding after gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgeries , current evidence has not been convincing . OBJECTIVE	The present randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of early oral feeding ( EOF ) with late oral feeding ( LOF ) following surgery for upper GI tumors . METHODS	One hundred and nine consecutive patients with esophageal or gastric tumors undergoing surgical resection in two hospitals in Tehran , Iran , were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial , and were randomly assigned to a group starting EOF on the first postoperative day and another group that remained nil by mouth until the return of bowel sounds ( LOF group ) . METHODS	The clinical and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups . RESULTS	The clinical outcomes were significantly better in the patients in the EOF group ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Repeated nil per os ( 14.8 vs. 30.9 % ) and re-hospitalization ( 1.8 vs. 7.3 % ) were more common in LOF group ( p < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Additionally , gas passage , nasogastric tube ( NGT ) discharge , a decrease in intravenous serum to less than 1000 ml per day , the time to start a soft diet and hospital discharge following surgery occurred significantly earlier in the EOF group than in the LOF group ( p < 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Early oral feeding after the surgical resection of esophageal and gastric tumors is safe , and is associated with favorable early in-hospital outcomes and a sooner return to physiological GI function and hospital discharge ."
"BACKGROUND	Excessive intravenous fluid prescription may play a causal role in postoperative complications following major gastrointestinal resectional surgery . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluid and salt restriction would decrease postoperative complications compared with a more modern controlled liberal regimen . METHODS	In this observer-blinded single-site randomized clinical trial consecutive patients undergoing major gastrointestinal resectional surgery were randomized to receive either a liberal control fluid regimen or a restricted fluid and salt regimen . METHODS	The primary outcome was postoperative complications of grade II and above ( moderate to severe ) . RESULTS	Some 240 patients ( 194 colorectal resections and 46 oesophagogastric resections ) were enrolled in the study ; 121 patients were randomized to the restricted regimen and 119 to the control ( liberal ) regimen . RESULTS	During surgery the control group received a median ( interquartile range ) fluid volume of 2033 ( 1576-2500 ) ml and sodium input of 282 ( 213-339 ) mmol , compared with 1000 ( 690-1500 ) ml and 142 ( 93-218 ) mmol respectively in the restricted group . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in major complication rate between groups ( 380 and 390 per cent respectively ) . RESULTS	Median ( range ) hospital stay was 8 ( 3-101 ) days in the controls and 8 ( range 3-76 ) days among those who received restricted fluids . RESULTS	There were four in-hospital deaths in the control group and two in the restricted group . RESULTS	Substantial differences in weight change , serum sodium , osmolality and urine : serum osmolality ratio were observed between the groups . CONCLUSIONS	There were no significant differences in major complication rates , length of stay and in-hospital deaths when fluid restriction was used compared with a more liberal regimen .

"BACKGROUND	Current thinking , which is based mainly on rodent studies , is that physiologic doses of folic acid ( pterylmonoglutamic acid ) , such as dietary vitamin folates , are biotransformed in the intestinal mucosa and transferred to the portal vein as the natural circulating plasma folate , 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid ( 5-MTHF ) before entering the liver and the wider systemic blood supply . OBJECTIVE	We tested the assumption that , in humans , folic acid is biotransformed ( reduced and methylated ) to 5-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa . METHODS	We conducted a crossover study in which we sampled portal and peripheral veins for labeled folate concentrations after oral ingestion with physiologic doses of stable-isotope-labeled folic acid or the reduced folate 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid ( 5-FormylTHF ) in 6 subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt ( TIPSS ) in situ . METHODS	The TIPSS allowed blood samples to be taken from the portal vein . RESULTS	Fifteen minutes after a dose of folic acid , 80 12 % of labeled folate in the hepatic portal vein was unmodified folic acid . RESULTS	In contrast , after a dose of labeled 5-FormylTHF , only 4 18 % of labeled folate in the portal vein was unmodified 5-FormylTHF , and the rest had been converted to 5-MTHF after 15 min ( postdose ) . CONCLUSIONS	The human gut appears to have a very efficient capacity to convert reduced dietary folates to 5-MTHF but limited ability to reduce folic acid . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , large amounts of unmodified folic acid in the portal vein are probably attributable to an extremely limited mucosal cell dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) capacity that is necessary to produce tetrahydrofolic acid before sequential methylation to 5-MTHF . CONCLUSIONS	This process would suggest that humans are reliant on the liver for folic acid reduction even though it has a low and highly variable DHFR activity . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , chronic liver exposure to folic acid in humans may induce saturation , which would possibly explain reports of systemic circulation of unmetabolized folic acid ."
"BACKGROUND	Red ginseng is prepared by steaming raw ginseng , a process believed to increase the pharmacological efficacy . BACKGROUND	Further bioconversion of red ginseng through fermentation is known to increase its intestinal absorption and bioactivity , and bioconversion diminishes the toxicity of red ginseng 's metabolite . BACKGROUND	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of daily supplementation with fermented red ginseng ( FRG ) on glycemic status in subjects with impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes . METHODS	This study was a four-week long , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . METHODS	Forty-two subjects with impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes were randomly allocated to two groups assigned to consume either the placebo or fermented red ginseng ( FRG ) three times per day for four weeks . METHODS	Fasting and postprandial glucose profiles during meal tolerance tests were assessed before and after the intervention . RESULTS	FRG supplementation led to a significant reduction in postprandial glucose levels and led to an increase in postprandial insulin levels compared to the placebo group . RESULTS	There was a consistently significant improvement in the glucose area under the curve ( AUC ) in the FRG group . RESULTS	However , fasting glucose , insulin , and lipid profiles were not different from the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	Daily supplementation with FRG lowered postprandial glucose levels in subjects with impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT01826409 ."
"BACKGROUND	Nonvariceal acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( AUGIB ) is often accompanied by post-discharge anaemia . OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether iron treatment can effectively treat anaemia and to compare a 3-month regimen of oral iron treatment with a single administration of intravenous iron prior to discharge . METHODS	Ninety-seven patients with nonvariceal AUGIB and anaemia were enrolled in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised study . METHODS	The patients were allocated to one of three groups , receiving a single intravenous administration of 1000 mg of iron ; oral iron treatment , 200 mg daily for 3 months ; or placebo , respectively . METHODS	The patients were followed up for 3 months . RESULTS	From week 4 onwards , patients receiving treatment had significantly higher haemoglobin levels compared with patients who received placebo only . RESULTS	At the end of treatment , the proportion of patients with anaemia was significantly higher in the placebo group ( P < 0.01 ) than in the treatment groups . RESULTS	Intravenous iron appeared to be more effective than oral iron in ensuring sufficient iron stores . CONCLUSIONS	Iron treatment is effective and essential for treating anaemia after nonvariceal acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding . CONCLUSIONS	The route of iron supplementation is less important in terms of the increase in haemoglobin levels . CONCLUSIONS	Iron stores are filled most effectively if intravenous iron supplementation is administered ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT00978575 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Effects of palm olein ( POL ) on calcium and fat metabolic balance and gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerance have been clinically evaluated but its use in combination with palm kernel oil ( PKO ) , and canola oil has not been similarly assessed in infants . METHODS	Calcium and fat balance and GI tolerance were evaluated in 33 healthy term infants ( age = 68-159 d ) in a randomized , double-blinded , 14 d crossover trial at a day care center in Salvador , Brazil ; followed by a 4d hospital ward metabolic balance study in 17 of the male subjects . METHODS	The study compared two commercially available milk-based powdered formulas in Brazil ; one containing POL ( 44 % of total fat ) , PKO ( 21.7 % ) and canola oil ( 18.5 % ) as predominant fats ( PALM ) , and the other containing none ( NoPALM ) . METHODS	Occasional human milk ( HM ) supplementation was allowed at home . RESULTS	Formula and HM intakes , and growth were not different ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Calcium absorption ( % ) for infants fed NoPALM ( 58.8 16.7 % ; means SD ) was higher ( p = 0.023 ) than those fed PALM ( 42.1 19.2 % ) , but was not significant ( p = 0.104 ) when calcium intake was used as a covariate . RESULTS	Calcium intake was higher ( p < 0.001 ) in NoPALM versus PALM fed infants . RESULTS	However , calcium retention ( % ) was higher in infants fed NoPALM compared to PALM with ( p = 0.024 ) or without ( p = 0.015 ) calcium intake as a covariate . RESULTS	Fat absorption ( % ) for NoPALM was greater than PALM fed infants ( NoPALM = 96.9 1.2 > PALM = 95.1 1.5 ; p = 0.020 in Study Period I ) . RESULTS	Mean rank stool consistency was softer in infants fed NoPALM versus PALM ( p < 0.001 ; metabolic period ) . RESULTS	Adverse events , spit-up/vomit , fussiness and gassiness were not different ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Formula acceptability was high and comparable for both formula feedings , regardless of HM supplementation . CONCLUSIONS	Term infants fed PALM based formula ( containing palm olein , palm kernel and canola oils ) demonstrated lower calcium retention and fat absorption , and less softer stool consistency versus infants fed NoPALM based formula . CONCLUSIONS	Study suggested formula fat differences may affect GI function in infants ."
"BACKGROUND	Foods that enhance satiety can help consumers to resist environmental cues to eat , and improve the nutritional quality of their diets . BACKGROUND	Viscosity generated by oat - glucan , influences gastrointestinal mechanisms that mediate satiety . BACKGROUND	Differences in the source , processing treatments , and interactions with other constituents in the food matrix affect the amount , solubility , molecular weight , and structure of the - glucan in products , which in turn influences the viscosity . BACKGROUND	This study examined the effect of two types of oatmeal and an oat-based ready-to-eat breakfast cereal ( RTEC ) on appetite , and assessed differences in meal viscosity and - glucan characteristics among the cereals . METHODS	Forty-eight individuals were enrolled in a randomized crossover trial . METHODS	Subjects consumed isocaloric breakfast meals containing instant oatmeal ( IO ) , old-fashioned oatmeal ( SO ) or RTEC in random order at least a week apart . METHODS	Each breakfast meal contained 218kcal ( 150kcal cereal , and 68kcal milk ) Visual analogue scales measuring appetite were completed before breakfast , and over four hours , following the meal . METHODS	Starch digestion kinetics , meal viscosities , and - glucan characteristics for each meal were determined . METHODS	Appetite responses were analyzed by area under the curve . METHODS	Mixed models were used to analyze response changes over time . RESULTS	IO increased fullness ( p = 0.04 ) , suppressed desire to eat ( p = 0.01 ) and reduced prospective intake ( p < 0.01 ) more than the RTEC over four hours , and consistently at the 60minute time-point . RESULTS	SO reduced prospective intake ( p = 0.04 ) more than the RTEC . RESULTS	Hunger scores were not significantly different except that IO reduced hunger more than the RTEC at the 60minute time-point . RESULTS	IO and SO had higher - glucan content , molecular weight , gastric viscosity , and larger hydration spheres than the RTEC , and IO had greater viscosity after oral and initial gastric digestion ( initial viscosity ) than the RTEC . CONCLUSIONS	IO and SO improved appetite control over four hours compared to RTEC . CONCLUSIONS	Initial viscosity of oatmeal may be especially important for reducing appetite ."
"BACKGROUND	This multi-center , phase III trial assesses the efficacy of daikenchuto ( TU-100 ) on gastrointestinal disorders after hepatic resection ( UMIN Registration No. 000003103 ) . METHODS	A total of 231 patients , who underwent hepatic resection at 26 Japanese centers , were enrolled . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral doses ( 15 g/day , three times a day ) of TU-100 or placebo control from preoperative day 3 to postoperative day 10 , except on the day of surgery . METHODS	Primary end points were the time from extubation until the first postoperative bowel movement ( FBM-T ) , serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and ammonia levels . RESULTS	Finally , 209 patients ( TU-100 : n = 108 , placebo : n = 101 ) were included in the statistical analysis . RESULTS	The median FBM-T was 88.2 h ( 95 % CI 74.0-94 .1 ) in the TU-100 group and 93.1 h ( 95 % CI 83.3-99 .4 ) in the placebo group , demonstrating that TU-100 accelerated the time to first bowel movement significantly more than placebo control . RESULTS	Serum CRP levels did not differ significantly during the study period , although serum CRP levels in the TU-100 group tended to be lower than those in the placebo group in patients with grade B liver damage . RESULTS	Meanwhile , the two groups had similar serum ammonia levels . RESULTS	TU-100-related serious adverse events did not occur during the study . CONCLUSIONS	TU-100 appears to improve gastrointestinal dysmotility and reduce serum CRP levels in patients with grade B liver damage after hepatectomy . CONCLUSIONS	TU-100 is an effective treatment option after hepatic resection in patients with liver cancer ."
"OBJECTIVE	Little is known about whether probiotics can affect outcomes of patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) . OBJECTIVE	We assessed the efficacy of a probiotic preparation in preventing the recurrence of HE ( primary outcome ) and reducing the number of hospitalizations and severity of liver disease in patients with cirrhosis . METHODS	We performed a double-blind trial at a tertiary care hospital in India . METHODS	Patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from an episode of HE during the previous month were assigned randomly ( using computer-generated allocation ) to groups given a probiotic preparation ( VSL # 3 , 9 10 ( 11 ) bacteria ; CD Pharma India Private Limited , New Delhi , India ) ( n = 66 ) or placebo ( n = 64 ) daily for 6 months . RESULTS	There was a trend toward a reduction in the development of breakthrough HE among patients receiving the probiotic ( 34.8 % in the probiotic group vs 51.6 % in the placebo group ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.65 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.38-1 .11 ; P = .12 ) . RESULTS	Fewer patients in the probiotic group were hospitalized for HE ( 19.7 % vs 42.2 % , respectively ; HR , 0.45 ; 95 % CI , 0.23-0 .87 ; P = .02 ) or for complications of cirrhosis ( 24.2 % ) than in the placebo group ( 45.3 % ) ( HR , 0.52 ; 95 % CI , 0.28-0 .95 ; P = .034 ) . RESULTS	Child-Turcotte-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease scores improved significantly from baseline to 6 months in the probiotic group , but not in the placebo group . RESULTS	There were no adverse events related to VSL # 3 . CONCLUSIONS	Over a 6-month period , daily intake of VSL # 3 significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for HE , as well as Child-Turcotte-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease scores , in patients with cirrhosis . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov number : NCT01110447 ."
"BACKGROUND	Probiotic supplementation significantly reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC ) and all cause mortality in preterm neonates . BACKGROUND	Independent quality assessment is important before introducing routine probiotic supplementation in this cohort . OBJECTIVE	To assess product quality , and confirm that Bifidobacterium breve ( B. breve ) M-16V supplementation will increase fecal B. breve counts without adverse effects . METHODS	Strain identity ( 16S rRNA gene sequencing ) , viability over 2 year shelf-life were confirmed , and microbial contamination of the product was ruled out . METHODS	In a controlled trial preterm neonates ( Gestation < 33 weeks ) ready to commence or on feeds for < 12 hours were randomly allocated to either B. breve M-16V ( 3109 cfu/day ) or placebo ( dextrin ) supplementation until the corrected age 37 weeks . METHODS	Stool samples were collected before ( S1 ) and after 3 weeks of supplementation ( S2 ) for studying fecal B. breve levels using quantitative PCR ( Primary outcome ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes included total fecal bifidobacteria and NECStage II . METHODS	Categorical and continuous outcomes were analysed using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests , and McNemar and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired comparisons . RESULTS	A total of 159 neonates ( Probiotic : 79 , Placebo : 80 ) were enrolled . RESULTS	Maternal and neonatal demographic characteristics were comparable between the groups . RESULTS	The proportion of neonates with detectable B. breve increased significantly post intervention : Placebo : [ S1 :2 / 66 ( 3 % ) , S2 : 25/66 ( 38 % ) , p < 0.001 ] Probiotic : [ S1 : 29/74 ( 40 % ) , S2 : 67/74 ( 91 % ) , p < 0.001 ] . RESULTS	Median S1 B. breve counts in both groups were below detection ( < 4.7 log cells x g ( -1 ) ) , increasing significantly in S2 for the probiotic group ( log 8.6 ) while remaining < 4.7 log in the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	There were no adverse effects including probiotic sepsis and no deaths . RESULTS	NECStage II occurred in only 1 neonate ( placebo group ) . CONCLUSIONS	B. breve M-16V is a suitable probiotic strain for routine use in preterm neonates . BACKGROUND	Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN 12609000374268 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Guidelines consider certain probiotics useful in the management of acute gastroenteritis . OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the use of Lactobacillus ( L ) reuteri DSM 17938 . METHODS	A multicentre , randomised , single-blind clinical trial was performed in hospitalised children with acute gastroenteritis lasting 12-72 h. Children received conventional therapy with , or without , 1 10 ( 8 ) CFU of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 5 days . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the duration of diarrhoea and secondary outcomes were days of hospitalisation and the percentage of children with diarrhoea after each day of treatment . RESULTS	We compared 64 children receiving L. reuteri with 63 controls . RESULTS	Lactobacillus reuteri reduced the duration of diarrhoea after 24 h ( p < 0.001 ) and more diarrhoea-free children were seen in the L. reuteri than control group after 24 and 48 h ( 50 % versus 5 % , p < 0.001 ) and 72 h ( 69 % versus 11 % , p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Lactobacillus reuteri reduced mean hospital stays ( 4.31 1.3 days versus 5.46 1.77 days , p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Prolonged diarrhoea occurred in 17 % of the controls , but none of the L. reuteri group . RESULTS	No adverse effects were reported . CONCLUSIONS	Lactobacillus reuteri effectively reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea and hospital stays in children hospitalised with acute gastroenteritis . CONCLUSIONS	Outpatient data are now required ."
"BACKGROUND	Formula-fed ( FF ) infants often have harder stools and higher stool concentrations of fatty acid soaps compared to breastfed infants . BACKGROUND	Feeding high sn-2 palmitate or the prebiotic oligofructose ( OF ) may soften stools , reduce stool soaps , and decrease fecal calcium loss . METHODS	We investigated the effect of high sn-2 palmitate alone and in combination with OF on stool palmitate soap , total soap and calcium concentrations , stool consistency , gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerance , anthropometrics , and hydration in FF infants . METHODS	This double-blind trial randomized 165 healthy term infants 25-45 days old to receive Control formula ( n = 54 ) , formula containing high sn-2 palmitate ( sn-2 ; n = 56 ) , or formula containing high sn-2 palmitate plus 3 g/L OF ( sn-2 + OF ; n = 55 ) . METHODS	A non-randomized human milk ( HM ) - fed group was also included ( n = 55 ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint , stool composition , was determined after 28 days of feeding , and was assessed using ANOVA accompanied by pairwise comparisons . METHODS	Stool consistency , GI tolerance and hydration were assessed at baseline , day 14 ( GI tolerance only ) and day 28 . RESULTS	Infants fed sn-2 had lower stool palmitate soaps compared to Control ( P = 0.0028 ) ; while those fed sn-2 + OF had reduced stool palmitate soaps compared to both Control and sn-2 ( both P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Stool total soaps and calcium were lower in the sn-2 + OF group than either Control ( P < 0.0001 ) or sn-2 ( P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	The HM-fed group had lower stool palmitate soaps , total soaps and calcium ( P < 0.0001 for each comparison ) than all FF groups . RESULTS	The stool consistency score of the sn-2 + OF group was lower than Control and sn-2 ( P < 0.0001 ) , but higher than the HM-fed group ( P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	GI tolerance was similar and anthropometric z-scores were < 0.2 SD from the WHO growth standards in all groups , while urinary hydration markers were within normal range for all FF infants . CONCLUSIONS	Increasing sn-2 palmitate in infant formula reduces stool palmitate soaps . CONCLUSIONS	A combination of high sn-2 palmitate and OF reduces stool palmitate soaps , total soaps and calcium , while promoting softer stools . BACKGROUND	This study was registered on http://www.clinicaltrials.gov: number NCT02031003 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) is thought to intensify the physiological effects of the incretin hormones . OBJECTIVE	We investigated the effects of DPP4 inhibition on plasma levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP1 ) , incretin effect , glucose tolerance , gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal ( GIGD ) and gastric emptying in healthy subjects . METHODS	A randomised , controlled and open-labelled study . METHODS	Ten healthy subjects ( six women ; age , 405 years ( means.e.m . ) METHODS	; BMI , 243kg/m ( 2 ) ; fasting plasma glucose , 5.10.2 mmol/l and HbA1c , 341mmol/mol ( 5.30.1 % ) ) were randomised to two-paired study days comprising a 4-h 50g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) with paracetamol ( A ) and an isoglycaemic intravenous ( i.v. ) glucose infusion ( B ) , with ( A1 + B1 ) and without ( A2 + B2 ) preceding administration of the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin . RESULTS	Isoglycaemia was obtained in all subjects on the paired study days . RESULTS	Significant increases in fasting levels and OGTT-induced responses of active GLP1 and GIP were seen after DPP4 inhibition . RESULTS	No significant impact of DPP4 inhibition on fasting plasma glucose ( 5.10.1 vs 4.90.1 mmol/l , P = 0.3 ) , glucose tolerance ( area under the curve ( AUC ) for plasma glucose , 15135 vs 13726mmol/lmin , P = 0.7 ) or peak plasma glucose during OGTT ( 8.50.4 vs 8.10.3 mmol/l , P = 0.3 ) was observed . RESULTS	Neither incretin effect ( 409 % ( without DPP4 inhibitor ) vs 407 % ( with DPP4 inhibitor ) , P = 1.0 ) , glucagon responses ( 1395165 vs 1223195pmol/lmin , P = 0.41 ) , GIGD ( 524 vs 565 % , P = 0.40 ) nor gastric emptying ( Tmax for plasma paracetamol : 869 vs 8012min , P = 0.60 ) changed following DPP4 inhibition . CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that acute increases in active incretin hormone levels do not affect glucose tolerance , GIGD , incretin effect , glucagon responses or gastric emptying in healthy subjects ."
"BACKGROUND	Opioid-induced constipation is common and debilitating . BACKGROUND	We investigated the efficacy and safety of naloxegol , an oral , peripherally acting , - opioid receptor antagonist , for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation . METHODS	In two identical phase 3 , double-blind studies ( study 04 , 652 participants ; study 05 , 700 participants ) , outpatients with noncancer pain and opioid-induced constipation were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 12.5 or 25 mg of naloxegol or placebo . METHODS	The primary end point was the 12-week response rate ( 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week and an increase from baseline of 1 spontaneous bowel movements for 9 of 12 weeks and for 3 of the final 4 weeks ) in the intention-to-treat population . METHODS	The key secondary end points were the response rate in the subpopulation of patients with an inadequate response to laxatives before enrollment , time to first postdose spontaneous bowel movement , and mean number of days per week with one or more spontaneous bowel movements . RESULTS	Response rates were significantly higher with 25 mg of naloxegol than with placebo ( intention-to-treat population : study 04 , 44.4 % vs. 29.4 % , P = 0.001 ; study 05 , 39.7 % vs. 29.3 % , P = 0.02 ; patients with an inadequate response to laxatives : study 04 , 48.7 % vs. 28.8 % , P = 0.002 ; study 05 , 46.8 % vs. 31.4 % , P = 0.01 ) ; in study 04 , response rates were also higher in the group treated with 12.5 mg of naloxegol ( intention-to-treat population , 40.8 % vs. 29.4 % , P = 0.02 ; patients with an inadequate response to laxatives , 42.6 % vs. 28.8 % , P = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	A shorter time to the first postdose spontaneous bowel movement and a higher mean number of days per week with one or more spontaneous bowel movements were observed with 25 mg of naloxegol versus placebo in both studies ( P < 0.001 ) and with 12.5 mg of naloxegol in study 04 ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Pain scores and daily opioid dose were similar among the three groups . RESULTS	Adverse events ( primarily gastrointestinal ) occurred most frequently in the groups treated with 25 mg of naloxegol . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with naloxegol , as compared with placebo , resulted in a significantly higher rate of treatment response , without reducing opioid-mediated analgesia .

"OBJECTIVE	It is recommended that treatments that include clarithromycin should be avoided in eradication of Helicobacter pylori ( HP ) in cases where clarithromycin resistance is higher than 20 % . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to compare levofloxacin - and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies with standard treatment and with each other in eradication of helicobacter pylori as first-line therapy . METHODS	Patients were randomized prospectively as three groups . METHODS	There were 102 patients in the levofloxacin group , 101 patients in the moxifloxacin group , and 103 patients in the standard treatment group . METHODS	The patients received levofloxacin 500 mg daily , amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. for ten days ( LAL ) in the levofloxacin group ; moxifloxacin 400 mg daily , amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. ( MAL ) in the moxifloxacin group ; and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. , amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. ( CAL ) in the standard treatment group . METHODS	At post-treatment week 6 , HP was checked by using stool antigen test . RESULTS	In the eradication of Helicobacter pylori , the success rate as determined by per protocol ( PP ) analysis was 92 % in the LAL group , 91.8 % in the MAL group , and 82.4 % in the CAL group . RESULTS	A statistically significant difference was found in the LAL and MAL groups compared to the CAL group ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no difference between the LAL and MAL groups . CONCLUSIONS	It was determined that levofloxacin - and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies were more effective than the standard treatment in first-line setting in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori . CONCLUSIONS	In addition , no difference was found between levofloxacin - and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies . CONCLUSIONS	Currently observed high efficacy may be evaluated in treatment . CONCLUSIONS	Although quinolon resistance is not considered a major problem , it appears to be a factor that may reduce treatment success over a period of time ."
"BACKGROUND	Faecal short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) are produced by the gut microflora . BACKGROUND	We have previously reported high faecal SCFA levels in children with coeliac disease ( CD ) , indicating alteration in gut microfloral metabolism . BACKGROUND	Data accumulated over recent decades by us and others suggest that wheat-free oats can safely be included in a gluten-free diet ( GFD ) . BACKGROUND	However , concerns have been raised with respect to the safety of oats in a subset of coeliacs . OBJECTIVE	To describe faecal SCFA patterns in children with newly diagnosed CD treated for 1 year with a GFD with or without oats . METHODS	This report is part of a randomised , double-blind study on the effect of a GFD containing oats ( GFD-oats ) vs. a standard GFD ( GFD-std ) . METHODS	Faecal samples were received from 34 children in the GFD-oats group and 37 in the GFD-std group at initial diagnosis and/or after 1 year on a GFD . METHODS	Faecal SCFAs were analysed . RESULTS	The GFD-std group had a significantly lower total faecal SCFA concentration at 12 months compared with 0 months ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	In contrast , total SCFA in the GFD-oats group remained high after 1 year on the GFD . RESULTS	The children in the GFD-oats group had significantly higher acetic acid ( P < 0.05 ) , n-butyric acid ( P < 0.05 ) and total SCFA concentration ( P < 0.01 ) after 1-year diet treatment compared to the GFD-std group . CONCLUSIONS	Our results indicate that oats do affect the gut microflora function , and that some coeliac children receiving oats may develop gut mucosal inflammation , that may present a risk for future complications ."
"OBJECTIVE	Prucalopride is a selective , high-affinity agonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine ( serotonin ) receptor 4 that enhances motility in the gastrointestinal tract . OBJECTIVE	We performed a multicenter , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prucalopride in children ( 6 months to 18 years old ) with functional constipation . METHODS	Children with functional constipation , based on the Rome III criteria , were given prucalopride ( children 50 kg were given a 0.04 mg/kg oral solution ; children > 50 kg were given a 2-mg tablet ) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks . METHODS	The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of children with toileting skills who had a mean of 3 spontaneous bowel movements/week and 1 episode of fecal incontinence/2 weeks , from study weeks 5-8 ( responders ) . METHODS	Adverse events , clinical laboratory values , and electrocardiograms were monitored . RESULTS	Efficacy and safety were assessed in 213 children ( 106 prucalopride , 107 placebo ) . RESULTS	Twenty-five percent were younger than 4 years old , 50 % were 4-11 years old , and 25 % were 12-18 years old ; 55.4 % were girls . RESULTS	At screening , 62.3 % of patients in the prucalopride group and 55.1 % in the placebo group had a history of fecal incontinence ; 60.4 % and 55.1 % in the prucalopride and placebo groups , respectively , had a mean of 1 spontaneous bowel movements/week . RESULTS	The proportion of responders was similar between groups ( prucalopride , 17.0 % and placebo , 17.8 % ) . RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in the primary efficacy end point when patients were stratified by sex , age group , or country . RESULTS	The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in the prucalopride ( 69.8 % ) and placebo ( 60.7 % ) groups . CONCLUSIONS	Prucalopride , although generally well tolerated , was not more effective than placebo in children with functional constipation . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov Number : NCT01330381 ."
"OBJECTIVE	The goal of the study was to examine if intake of Lactobacillus plantarum can accelerate clearance of nontyphoid Salmonella and reduce infection-related symptoms . BACKGROUND	Nontyphoid Salmonella is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide . BACKGROUND	Few studies have explored the effect of probiotics in these infections . METHODS	Patients with Salmonella infection were randomized to daily intake of 5 10 colony forming units of freeze-dried Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v or placebo . METHODS	Symptoms were recorded daily . METHODS	Feces were cultured weekly . METHODS	Treatment continued until 4 consecutive stool cultures negative for Salmonella had been obtained . RESULTS	The treatment and placebo groups did not differ significantly with regard to time to clearance of Salmonella , or time to resolution of symptoms . RESULTS	Irrespective of treatment , women tended to clear Salmonella more rapidly than men ( 19 vs. 28 d , P = 0.18 ) , despite a longer diarrheal phase ( 5 vs. 3 days after inclusion , P = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	After Salmonella clearance ( postinfectious phase ) , women experienced loose stools , nausea , and flatulence more frequently than men . RESULTS	In women , L. plantarum treatment was associated with more abdominal pain , whereas in men L. plantarum treatment reduced the prevalence of hard stools , and increased the presence of diarrheal symptoms in the postinfectious phase . CONCLUSIONS	Gender , but not administration of the probiotic strain L. plantarum 299 v , may influence acute symptoms during Salmonella infection and possibly clearance of Salmonella . CONCLUSIONS	Symptoms in the postinfectious phase were modified by the probiotics in a gender-specific way , but our results give little support for positive effects of L. plantarum 299 v treatment in nontyphoid salmonellosis ."
"OBJECTIVE	To determine whether the application of occlusive wrap applied immediately after birth will reduce mortality in very preterm infants . METHODS	This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of infants born 24 0/7 to 27 6/7 weeks ' gestation who were assigned randomly to occlusive wrap or no wrap . METHODS	The primary outcome was all cause mortality at discharge or 6 months ' corrected age . METHODS	Secondary outcomes included temperature , Apgar scores , pH , base deficit , blood pressure and glucose , respiratory distress syndrome , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , seizures , patent ductus arteriosus , necrotizing enterocolitis , gastrointestinal perforation , intraventricular hemorrhage , cystic periventricular leukomalacia , pulmonary hemorrhage , retinopathy of prematurity , sepsis , hearing screen , and pneumothorax . RESULTS	Eight hundred one infants were enrolled . RESULTS	There was no difference in baseline population characteristics . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in mortality ( OR 1.0 , 95 % CI 0.7-1 .5 ) . RESULTS	Wrap infants had statistically significant greater baseline temperatures ( 36.3 C wrap vs 35.7 C no wrap , P < .0001 ) and poststabilization temperatures ( 36.6 C vs 36.2 C , P < .001 ) than nonwrap infants . RESULTS	For the secondary outcomes , there was a significant decrease in pulmonary hemorrhage ( OR 0.6 , 95 % CI 0.3-0 .9 ) in the wrap group and a significant lower mean one minute Apgar score ( P = .007 ) in the wrap group . RESULTS	The study was stopped early because continued enrollment would not result in the attainment of a significant difference in the primary outcome . CONCLUSIONS	Application of occlusive wrap to very preterm infants immediately after birth results in greater mean body temperature but does not reduce mortality ."
"BACKGROUND	Despite the intensive global efforts to control intestinal parasitic infections , the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections is still very high in many developing countries particularly among children in rural areas . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 250 Aboriginal schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on STH reinfection . METHODS	The effect of the supplement was assessed at 3 and 6 months after receiving interventions ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg/daily of albendazole tablets . RESULTS	Almost all children ( 98.6 % ) were infected with at least one STH species . RESULTS	The overall prevalence of ascariasis , trichuriasis and hookworm infection was 67.8 % , 95.5 % and 13.4 % , respectively . RESULTS	Reinfection rates of Ascaris , Trichuris and hookworm were high ; at 6 months , assessment reached 80 % of the prevalence reported before treatment . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the reinfection rates and intensities of STH between vitamin A supplemented-children and those who received placebo at 3 and 6 months ( p > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Vitamin A supplementation showed no protective effect against STH reinfection and this could be due to the high endemicity of STH in this community . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term interventions to reduce poverty will help significantly in reducing this continuing problem and there is no doubt that reducing intestinal parasitic infection would have a positive impact on the health , nutrition and education of these children . BACKGROUND	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00936091 ."
"BACKGROUND	Diet and lifestyle modification is commonly used in constipation management . BACKGROUND	As there is a dearth of studies on this topic in Malaysia , we aim to elucidate the relations between stool patterns , dietary intake and physical activity levels among adults with functional constipation . METHODS	From a database collected via surveys at public events , a convenience sample of 100 adults diagnosed with Rome II-defined functional constipation was enrolled in this cross-sectional study . METHODS	After severity assessment using the Chinese Constipation Questionnaire , subjects completed 2-week bowel movement diaries to determine stool frequency , consistency and output . METHODS	Dietary intake and physical activity levels were assessed twice using three-day 24-hour diet recalls and International Physical Activity Questionnaire , respectively . METHODS	Ninety subjects who completed the study were included in the analysis . RESULTS	Mean weekly stool frequency was 3.9 + / - 1.9 times , consistency score was 2.6 + / - 0.6 ( range 1.0-4 .0 ) , output was 11.0 + / - 6.3 balls ( 40 mm diameter ) and severity score was 10.3 + / - 3.3 ( range 5.0-22 .0 ) . RESULTS	Mean daily dietary intakes were : energy 1,719 + / - 427kcal , dietary fibre 15.0 + / - 4.9 g and fluid 2.5 + / - 0.8 L. RESULTS	The majority of subjects were physically inactive . RESULTS	Stool frequency and output were positively associated with dietary fibre ( r ( s ) = 0.278 , P < 0.01 ; r ( s ) = 0.226 , P < 0.05 ) and fluid intake ( r ( s ) = 0.257 , P < 0.05 ; OR = 3.571 , 95 % CI [ 1.202-10 .609 ] ) . RESULTS	Constipation severity was associated with higher physical activity levels ( OR = 2.467 , 95 % CI [ 1.054-5 .777 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	Insufficient intake of dietary fibre and fluid are associated with aggravated constipation symptoms . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are necessary to confirm usefulness of dietary intervention in treatment of constipation as dietary factors alone may not influence overall severity and stool consistency , an integral element of constipation ."
"BACKGROUND	Oral antibiotics use in infants in developing countries is challenging because liquid formulations are often unavailable . BACKGROUND	However , dissolving solid formulation of drugs in water poses a risk of gastrointestinal infection . BACKGROUND	Although mother 's milk may be a potential vehicle , no evidence exists to indicate that antibiotics dissolved in human milk are bioequivalent to those dissolved in water . BACKGROUND	Therefore , we compared pharmacokinetic parameters of an orally administered antibiotic , amoxicillin , dissolved in human milk , to those of water-dissolved amoxicillin . METHODS	A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 healthy adult volunteers in a randomised crossover design . METHODS	Marketed amoxicillin powder for suspension was dissolved in either human milk or water at a final concentration of 50 mg/mL , and 10 mL was given orally in a fasting state . METHODS	Timed blood samples were obtained and plasma amoxicillin was quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . RESULTS	Results showed that pharmacokinetic parameters , including area-under-the-curve , Cmax and half-life of the water-based and milk-based amoxicillin administration were not significantly different . RESULTS	90 % CIs of the ratios of these parameters in concomitant breast milk administration to those of water were within 89 % and 116 % , suggesting they are bioequivalent ( defined as a range between 80 % and 125 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that oral administration of amoxicillin dissolved in human milk at 50 mg/mL results in pharmacokinetics profiles comparable to amoxicillin dissolved in water . CONCLUSIONS	Pharmaceutical interactions between amoxicillin and breast milk are unlikely , suggesting no need to modify dosing schedules ."
"OBJECTIVE	Ramosetron , a serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ) -3 receptor antagonist with high selectivity , reduced stress-induced diarrhea and defecation caused by corticotropin-releasing hormone in rats . OBJECTIVE	However , there have been no clinical trials of its effect in patients with diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D ) . OBJECTIVE	We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to determine whether ramosetron reduces diarrhea in these patients . METHODS	Our study included 296 male outpatients with IBS-D treated at 52 centers in Japan . METHODS	Patients were given 5 g oral ramosetron ( n = 147 ) or placebo ( n = 149 ) once daily for 12 weeks after a 1-week baseline period . METHODS	The primary end point was increased stool consistency in the first month . METHODS	Secondary end points included relief of overall IBS symptoms and increased IBS-related quality of life . RESULTS	More patients given ramosetron ( 74 , 50.3 % ) than those given placebo ( 29 , 19.6 % ) reported improved stool consistency in the first month ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	The relative risk and number needed to treat were 2.57 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.79-3 .70 ) and 3.25 ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.44-4 .89 ) , respectively . RESULTS	The ramosetron group had significantly higher monthly rates of relief of overall IBS symptoms and IBS-related quality of life than the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	Ramosetron ( 5 g oral , once daily for 12 weeks ) improved stool consistency in male patients with IBS-D , compared with placebo . CONCLUSIONS	These study results , along with the pharmacologic profile of ramosetron , indicate that increased stool consistency is the best end point for studies of ramosetron in patients with IBS-D . CONCLUSIONS	Clinicaltrials.gov No , NCT01225237 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Two treatment strategies were compared in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) on basal insulin requiring intensification : addition of once-daily ( OD ) liraglutide ( Lira ) or OD insulin aspart ( IAsp ) with largest meal . METHODS	Subjects completing 104weeks ( 52-week main trial BEGIN ONCE-LONG + 52-week extension ) on insulin degludec ( IDeg ) OD + metformin with HbA1c7 .0 % ( 53mmol/mol ) were randomized to IDeg + Lira [ n = 88 , mean HbA1c : 7.7 % ( 61mmol/mol ) ] or IDeg + IAsp ( n = 89 , mean HbA1c : 7.7 % ) for 26weeks , continuing metformin . METHODS	Subjects completing 104weeks with HbA1c < 7.0 % continued IDeg + metformin in a third , non-randomized arm ( n = 236 ) . RESULTS	IDeg + Lira reduced HbA1c ( -0.74 % - points ) significantly more than IDeg + IAsp ( -0.39 % - points ) ; estimated treatment difference ( ETD ) ( IDeg + Lira-IDeg + IAsp ) -0.32 % - points ( 95 % CI -0.53 ; -0.12 ) ; p = 0.0024 . RESULTS	More IDeg + Lira ( 49.4 % ) than IDeg + IAsp ( 7.2 % ) subjects achieved HbA1c < 7.0 % without confirmed hypoglycaemia [ plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/l ( < 56mg/dl ) or severe hypoglycaemia ) and without weight gain ; estimated odds ratio ( IDeg + Lira/IDeg + IAsp ) 13.79 ( 95 % CI 5.24 ; 36.28 ) ; p < 0.0001 . RESULTS	IDeg + Lira subjects had significantly less confirmed and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia , and significantly greater weight loss ( -2.8 kg ) versus IDeg + IAsp ( +0.9 kg ) ; ETD ( IDeg + Lira-IDeg + IAsp ) -3.75 kg ( 95 % CI -4.70 ; -2.79 ) ; p < 0.0001 . RESULTS	Other than more gastrointestinal side effects with IDeg + Lira , no safety differences occurred . RESULTS	Durability of IDeg was established in the non-randomized arm , as mean HbA1c remained < 7.0 % [ mean 6.5 % ( 48mmol/mol ) at end-of-trial ] . CONCLUSIONS	IDeg + Lira improved long-term glycaemic control , with weight loss and less hypoglycaemia versus adding a single daily dose of IAsp in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with IDeg + metformin ."
"BACKGROUND	The prevalence of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) in youth is increasing . BACKGROUND	Treatment options beyond metformin and insulin are needed . BACKGROUND	The safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide once daily in youth ( 10-17 years old ) with T2D were investigated in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . METHODS	Youth treated with diet/exercise alone or with metformin and having a hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level of 6.5-11 % were randomized to liraglutide ( n = 14 ) or placebo ( n = 7 ) . METHODS	Starting at 0.3 mg/day , doses were escalated weekly to 0.6 , 0.9 , 1.2 , and 1.8 mg/day ( or placebo equivalent ) for 5 weeks . RESULTS	Nineteen participants completed the trial .

"OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether sacral nerve stimulation reduces irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) - specific symptoms by a randomized , controlled , crossover study . BACKGROUND	IBS affects 3 % to 22 % of the population worldwide , but most patients continue to have symptoms despite treatment . METHODS	Patients included from our tertiary center had diarrhea-predominant or mixed IBS , with a minimum baseline IBS symptom score ( Gastrointestinal Syndrome Rating Scale-IBS questionnaire ) of 40 points reduced by a minimum of 30 % during the percutaneous nerve evaluation before permanent implantation . METHODS	Patients were randomized ( 1:1 ) to have the stimulator ON or OFF for 1 month and then the opposite for another month . METHODS	Investigators and patients were not informed of the setting . METHODS	IBS-specific symptoms and quality of life were assessed through bowel diaries and validated questionnaires . METHODS	Primary endpoint was the IBS-specific symptom score . RESULTS	Twenty-one patients were randomized . RESULTS	Ten were eligible for analysis in each group . RESULTS	IBS-specific symptom scores were significantly reduced during stimulation : the median difference in the ON-OFF group was 12 ( range , -22 to 44 ) and in the OFF-ON group -17.5 ( range , -48 to -1 ) ( P = 0.0009 ) . RESULTS	IBS-specific quality-of-life scores improved significantly during stimulation : the median difference in the ON-OFF group was 16 ( range , -24 to 69 ) and in the OFF-ON group -42.5 ( range , -77 to 0 ) ( P = 0.0003 ) . RESULTS	At 1-year follow-up , the median IBS-specific symptom score ( 25 ; range , 13-65 ) was significantly lower than that at baseline ( 62 ; range , 45-80 ) ( P = 0.0001 ) .

"BACKGROUND	High level of serum cholesterol is considered to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . BACKGROUND	A double-blinded , randomized , placebo-controlled trial was performed to test the hypothesis that a daily intake of Chlorella may improve serum lipid profile through enhancement of serum carotenoid concentration in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects . METHODS	Eligible subjects ( n = 63 ) were randomized to either Chlorella ( 5g/day ) or placebo for a double-blinded trial with a 2-week lead-in period and a 4-week intervention period . METHODS	Serum triglycerides , total cholesterol , lipoproteins , apolipoproteins and carotenoids were assessed at the beginning and the end of the trial . RESULTS	Compared with the control group , the Chlorella group exhibited remarkable changes in total cholesterol ( Chlorella -1.6 % ; placebo 0.03 % ; P = 0.036 ) , triglycerides ( Chlorella -10.3 % ; placebo 11.9 % ; P = 0.002 ) , lutein/zeaxanthin ( Chlorella 89.6 % ; placebo -1.7 % ; P < 0.0001 ) , and - carotene ( Chlorella 163.6 % ; placebo 15 % ; P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Improvement of serum lipids was supported by significant reductions of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( Chlorella -11 % ; placebo 11.8 % ; P = 0.006 ) , apolipoprotein B ( Chlorella -1.5 % ; placebo 1.7 % ; P = 0.044 ) , non high-density lipoprotein ( Chlorella -2.6 % ; placebo -0.5 % ; P = 0.032 ) , and high-density lipoprotein/triglycerides ( Chlorella 4.0 % ; placebo -9.5 % ; P = 0.023 ) , suggesting an inhibitory effect of Chlorella on the intestinal absorption of dietary and endogenous lipids . RESULTS	Further , the changes of serum lipids appeared to be associated with the changes of serum carotenoids . CONCLUSIONS	Daily consumption of Chlorella supplements provided the potential of health benefits reducing serum lipid risk factors , mainly triglycerides and total cholesterol , in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects . CONCLUSIONS	The effect was related to carotenoid consumption . BACKGROUND	WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform KCT0000259 ."

"OBJECTIVE	Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) continues to be evaluated and recommended as treatment and prophylaxis for various diseases . OBJECTIVE	We recently assessed efficacy of high-dose DHA supplementation to slow vision loss in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa ( XLRP ) in a randomized clinical trial . OBJECTIVE	Because DHA is a highly unsaturated fatty acid , it could serve as a target for free-radical induced oxidation , resulting in increased oxidative stress . OBJECTIVE	Biosafety was monitored during the 4-year trial to determine whether DHA supplementation was associated with identifiable risks . METHODS	Males ( n = 78 ; 7-31 years ) meeting entry criteria were enrolled . METHODS	The modified intent-to-treat cohort ( DHA = 33 ; placebo = 27 ) adhered to the protocol 1 year . METHODS	Participants were randomized to an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/d DHA or placebo plus a daily multivitamin . METHODS	Comprehensive metabolic analyses were assessed for group differences . METHODS	Treatment-emergent adverse events including blood chemistry metabolites were recorded . RESULTS	By year 4 , supplementation elevated plasma and red blood cell-DHA 4.4 - and 3.6-fold , respectively , compared with the placebo group ( P < 0.00001 ) . RESULTS	Over the trial duration , no significant differences between DHA and placebo groups were found for vitamin A , vitamin E , platelet aggregation , antioxidant activity , lipoprotein cholesterol , or oxidized LDL levels ( all P > 0.14 ) . RESULTS	Adverse events were transient and not considered severe ( e.g. , gastrointestinal [ GI ] irritability , blood chemistry alterations ) . RESULTS	One participant was unable to tolerate persistent GI discomfort . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term , high-dose DHA supplementation to patients with XLRP was associated with limited safety risks in this 4-year trial . CONCLUSIONS	Nevertheless , GI symptoms should be monitored in all patients taking high dose DHA especially those with personal or family history of GI disturbances .

"BACKGROUND	Low-fluence Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet 1,064-nm laser ( LFQS ) and glycolic acid ( GA ) peeling have been reported as a treatment option for melasma . BACKGROUND	However , there are limited data on their efficacy in men . OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of LFQS monotherapy with combined LFQS and 30 % GA peeling in male patients with melasma . METHODS	Fifteen males with mixed type melasma were randomized to receive 5 weekly sessions of LFQS on one side of the face and LFQS plus 30 % GA peeling on the contralateral side and were followed for 12 weeks . METHODS	Twelve patients completed the protocol . RESULTS	Mean relative lightness index ( RL * I ) of the combined treatment side was lowered throughout the study period , with the maximal improvement of 52.3 % reduction at the fourth week follow-up ( p = .023 ) . RESULTS	Patient self-assessment was favorable in the combined treatment . RESULTS	However , the mean RL * I increased at 8 and 12 weeks of follow-up . RESULTS	One subject ( 8.3 % ) developed guttate hypopigmentation , which did not resolve by the 12-week follow-up . CONCLUSIONS	Low-fluence Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet 1,064-nm laser combined with GA peeling temporarily reduced melasma in men , but the incidence of side effects does not justify the short-lived benefits of this procedure . CONCLUSIONS	This technique requires further study ."
"BACKGROUND	Probiotic bacteria have been shown to have various effects on the microbiota ; this may also affect appetite and may help promote weight loss and maintenance . OBJECTIVE	This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp paracasei L. casei W8 ( L. casei W8 ) on glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) responses in an isolated pig intestine , in piglets and postprandially in humans . OBJECTIVE	Additionally , the effect on subjective appetite , ad libitum energy intake , and glucose and insulin responses in humans was investigated . METHODS	Piglets were fed with probiotics for 2 weeks and the effect on glucagon encoding gene ( GCG ) was investigated . METHODS	An isolated pig intestine was perfused with L. casei W8 and the GLP-1 response was measured . METHODS	Twenty-one subjects completed a randomized , controlled , crossover study with three arms . METHODS	Each participant completed 3 test days testing the effect of low dose ( LD ) ( 10 ( 9 ) CFU ) , high dose ( HD ) ( 10 ( 10 ) CFU ) L. casei W8 or placebo capsule . METHODS	Subjective appetite was assessed before an ad libitum lunch was served . METHODS	GLP-1 , insulin and glucose concentrations were analyzed . RESULTS	Two weeks of treatment of piglets with L. casei W8 resulted in an increase in GCG expression compared to control animals ( P < .05 ) . RESULTS	L. casei W8 increased the GLP-1 response in the isolated pig intestine . RESULTS	In humans , L. casei W8 had an overall effect on energy intake ( P = 0.03 ) , but no effects on subjective appetite sensation , overall glucose and insulin response and on GLP-1 release were observed ( P > 0.1 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The probiotic bacteria L. casei W8 appears to lower food intake acutely , but the underlying mechanisms are not understood ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the microflora of root canals in primary molars following use of rotary NiTi files and conventional hand NiTi and stainless steel files . METHODS	This randomized clinical trial consisted of a total of 60 first and second primary molars requiring root canal treatment , who were selected from children aged 5-9 years . METHODS	Based on type of root canal instrumentation , the teeth were randomly assigned to three groups of twenty teeth each ; Group A : Rotary NiTi files , Group B : Hand NiTi files and Group C : Hand stainless steel files . METHODS	Following administration of local anesthesia , isolation with rubber dam was carried out . METHODS	For the purpose of instrumentation and sampling , the palatal canal of maxillary molars and the distal canal of mandibular molars were selected .

"BACKGROUND	SMOFlipid 20 % is intravenous lipid emulsion ( ILE ) containing long-chain triglycerides ( LCT ) , medium-chain triglycerides ( MCT ) , olive oil , and fish oil as a mixed emulsion containing - tocopherol . BACKGROUND	The aim was to assess the efficacy of this new ILE in gastrointestinal surgery compared with MCT/LCT . METHODS	In this prospective study , 40 patients were randomized to SMOFlipid 20 % or MCT/LCT ( Lipovenoes 20 % ) group . METHODS	Clinical and biochemistry data were collected . METHODS	Inflammatory markers ( CRP , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF - , TGF-1 ) and oxidative stress ( ROS and superoxide ) were measured . RESULTS	Thirty-five patients ( 17 males and 18 females ) with a mean age of 57 years completed the study . RESULTS	The patients ' demographic characteristics ( age , gender , height , body weight , and BMI ) were similar without significant differences between groups . RESULTS	The increment of triglyceride on day 6 from baseline was significantly lower in SMOFlipid group than in Lipovenoes MCT/LCT group . RESULTS	Inflammatory markers , as well as superoxide radical and total oxygen radical were not different between groups . CONCLUSIONS	Despite the comparable effect on inflammatory response , because of its well-balanced fatty acid pattern , relatively low n-6 : n-3 ratio , and high vitamin E content , SMOFlipid had a better triglyceride-lowering effect as compared with MCT/LCT in adult patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery ."
"BACKGROUND	Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) is a common and potentially curable cause of gastric mucosa lesion . BACKGROUND	This study investigated the relationship of Hp infection with histological changes in gastric mucosa and gastric cancer in Hp-positive patients compared with Hp-eradication patients followed up for ten years . METHODS	From an initial group of 1 006 adults , 552 Hp-positive subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment group ( T ; n = 276 ) or a placebo group ( P ; n = 276 ) . METHODS	In the randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel trial , T group subjects received oral doses of omeprazole , amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 1 week ; those in the P group received a placebo . METHODS	One month after treatment ended , a 13C urea breath test was performed , and Hp was undetectable in 88.89 % of the T group . METHODS	All subjects were followed at 1 , 5 , 8 , and 10 years after treatment , with endoscopy and biopsies for histological examination . RESULTS	Gastric mucosa inflammation was significantly milder in the T group than that in the P group one year after Hp eradication and this persisted for 10 years . RESULTS	Glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia ( IM ) had deteriorated in both groups during ten years . RESULTS	However , the increased score of glandular atrophy at both the gastric antrum and corpus , and IM only at the gastric antrum , in the P group was more obvious than that in the T group . RESULTS	During the 10 years , 9 patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer ( 2 in the T group ; 7 in the P group ; P = 0.176 ) . RESULTS	When mucosal atrophy was absent at the gastric antrum and corpus when entering the study , the incidence of gastric cancer in the P group ( n = 6 ) was much higher than that in the T group ( n = 0 , P = 0.013 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Hp eradication may significantly diminish and help halt progression of gastric mucosal inflammation and delay the development of IM and atrophy gastritis . CONCLUSIONS	Hp eradication is helpful for reducing the risk for gastric cancer , especially in the early stage of Hp infection ."

METHODS	A pragmatic , multicenter , parallel-group , randomized clinical trial , the Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization ( PROFHER ) trial , recruited 250 patients aged 16 years or older ( mean age , 66 years [ range , 24-92 years ] ; 192 [ 77 % ] were female ; and 249 [ 99.6 % ] were white ) who presented at the orthopedic departments of 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck . METHODS	Patients were followed up for 2 years ( up to April 2013 ) and 215 had complete follow-up data . METHODS	The data for 231 patients ( 114 in surgical group and 117 in nonsurgical group ) were included in the primary analysis . METHODS	Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques . METHODS	Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization . METHODS	Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups . METHODS	Primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score ( range , 0-48 ; higher scores indicate better outcomes ) assessed during a 2-year period , with assessment and data collection at 6 , 12 , and 24 months . METHODS	Sample size was based on a minimal clinically important difference of 5 points for the Oxford Shoulder Score . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were the Short-Form 12 ( SF-12 ) , complications , subsequent therapy , and mortality . RESULTS	There was no significant mean treatment group difference in the Oxford Shoulder Score averaged over 2 years ( 39.07 points for the surgical group vs 38.32 points for the nonsurgical group ; difference of 0.75 points [ 95 % CI , -1.33 to 2.84 points ] ; P = .48 ) or at individual time points . RESULTS	There were also no significant between-group differences over 2 years in the mean SF-12 physical component score ( surgical group : 1.77 points higher [ 95 % CI , -0.84 to 4.39 points ] ; P = .18 ) ; the mean SF-12 mental component score ( surgical group : 1.28 points lower [ 95 % CI , -3.80 to 1.23 points ] ; P = .32 ) ; complications related to surgery or shoulder fracture ( 30 patients in surgical group vs 23 patients in nonsurgical group ; P = .28 ) , requiring secondary surgery to the shoulder ( 11 patients in both groups ) , and increased or new shoulder-related therapy ( 7 patients vs 4 patients , respectively ; P = .58 ) ; and mortality ( 9 patients vs 5 patients ; P = .27 ) .

"BACKGROUND	Statins are currently the preferred pharmacological therapy in individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) with the aim to prevent premature atherosclerosis . BACKGROUND	In adults , these agents have been proven to be safe and well tolerated ; however , non-adherence is a significant clinical issue . OBJECTIVE	In this study , we evaluated tolerability and adherence to statin therapy in young adult FH patients 10 years after this was initiated in their childhood . METHODS	A questionnaire including items on medical history , adherence and reasons for discontinuation was sent to 214 young adult FH patients that initiated statin therapy at least 10 years ago . METHODS	Tolerability was defined as 100 % minus the percentage of patients that discontinued statin therapy due to side effects . METHODS	Adherence was defined as the extent to which patients took their medication as prescribed by their physician . METHODS	We labelled patients adherent if they took 80 % or more of their pills in the month preceding our assessment . RESULTS	Follow-up was successful in 205 ( 95.8 % ) subjects ( age 18-30 years ) . RESULTS	A history of side effects was reported by 40 ( 19.5 % ) of the patients , and mainly consisted of muscle complaints and gastrointestinal symptoms . RESULTS	Three patients ( 1.5 % ) discontinued statin therapy because of side effects . RESULTS	Rhadbomyolysis or other serious adverse events were not reported . RESULTS	In fact , 169 ( 82.4 % ) of 205 patients remained on statin treatment and 78.7 % ( 148 out of 188 ) were adherent . RESULTS	None of the patient characteristics were significantly associated with adherence . CONCLUSIONS	Individuals with FH who started statin therapy in childhood demonstrated good adherence during ten years of treatment . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , statin therapy was well tolerated ; only a small minority discontinued therapy because of side effects and the side effects that were reported were mild in nature ."

METHODS	Sixty-six cirrhotic outpatients ( EBL group , n = 32 and EBL+PP group , n = 34 ) with high-risk EVs without previous bleeding were studied . METHODS	The primary outcome was recurrence of EV . METHODS	The secondary outcomes were EV eradication , bleeding before EV eradication , mortality , and adverse events . RESULTS	Demographic characteristics and the initial endoscopic findings were similar . RESULTS	EV eradication was achieved in all patients . RESULTS	Three patients presented gastrointestinal bleeding before variceal eradication , two in the EBL group and one in the EBL+PP group ( P = 0.13 ) . RESULTS	Six patients died ( liver failure ) , two in the EBL group and four in the EBL+PP group ( P = 0.27 ) . RESULTS	Twelve ( 38 % ) patients in the EBL group and three ( 9 % ) patients in the EBL+PP group had variceal recurrence . RESULTS	The risk of recurrence of EVs after eradication was significantly higher among patients in the EBL group ( P = 0.003 ) . CONCLUSIONS	EBL alone and EBL+PP were effective in the primary prophylaxis of bleeding from EVs in cirrhotic patients ( EV eradication , bleeding before EV eradication , mortality , and adverse events were similar in both groups ) . CONCLUSIONS	However , variceal recurrence was lower in the EBL+PP group than band ligation alone ."
"OBJECTIVE	A classic general anesthesia is performed by induction with an intravenous hypnotic ( such as propofol ) and maintenance with a volatile anesthetic ( such as sevoflurane ) . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a propofol/sevoflurane maintenance regimen with that of a sevoflurane regimen on recovery profiles . METHODS	One hundred and sixty patients , who were ASA 1 or 2 , 45-65 years of age , and scheduled for elective gastrointestinal surgery under combined general/epidural anesthesia , were allocated randomly to receive the sevoflurane maintenance regimen ( group S , n = 80 ) or sevoflurane/propofol regimen ( group SP , n = 80 ) . METHODS	After induction , anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in group S and sevoflurane with propofol ( 1.2 g/ml target plasma concentration ) in group SP . METHODS	Bispectral index ( BIS ) values were maintained within 40-60 during the maintenance . METHODS	Time to extubation , incidence of serious coughing and agitation , and other recovery characteristics were evaluated during emergence . RESULTS	The time to awakening and extubation in group SP were 7.2 2 min and 8.0 1.8 min , respectively , which were shorter than those results in group S ( 12.3 1.5 and 12.8 1.6 min , respectively ) ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The incidence of serious coughing and agitation in SP ( 30 % and 25 % ) was lower than that of group S ( 68 % and 53 % ) ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	BIS value , pain score , requirements of analgesics and antiemetics in the PACU , and length of stay in the PACU were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	Compared to sevoflurane maintenance , coadministration of propofol and sevoflurane provides faster awakening and extubation with a low incidence of emergence coughing and agitation ."
"OBJECTIVE	In a previous uncontrolled experiment , oral vancomycin improved the symptoms ( S ) of chronic constipation ( CC ) . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this 21 day controlled pilot study was to determine if a low lincomycin dose improved the S of CC patients unresponsive to a high fiber diet . METHODS	On days 0-to-10 , patients were randomized to 500 mg oral lincomycin + high fiber ( L + F ) or to placebo + high fiber ( P + F ) . METHODS	Participants and patients were blinded . METHODS	From days 10-to-21 , patients were continued solely on the high fiber diet . METHODS	The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in S between L + F and P + F from days 0-to-21 using a visual analog scale ( VAS ) calibrated from 0 = severe S to 10 = asymptomatic . RESULTS	The means of all S were significantly improved by L + F but not by P + F. RESULTS	A significant higher proportion of L + F patients increased the VAS > or = 3 points . CONCLUSIONS	The initial course of L facilitated the effect of F probably by its effect on the colon flora . CONCLUSIONS	This sequence of flora-altering biologics + F may serve as model to replace chronic use of drugs ."
"BACKGROUND	Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) is a chronic gastrointestinal ( GI ) disorder that affects 15-20 % of the Western population . BACKGROUND	There are currently few therapeutic options available for the treatment of IBS . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a medical device containing a combination of Simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in the treatment of IBS . METHODS	This is a monocentric double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial . METHODS	Adult subjects suffering from IBS as defined by Rome III criteria were enrolled . METHODS	Bloating , discomfort , abdominal pain were assessed as primary end point . METHODS	Subjects received the active treatment or placebo 3 time a day after each meal for 4 weeks of study period . METHODS	Subjects were submitted to visit at Day 0 ( T1 ) , at Days 14 ( T2 ) and 29 ( T3 ) . RESULTS	Fifty-two patients were included into the study . RESULTS	Intragroup analysis showed a significant reduction of the bloating , discomfort and pain in Colinox group ( CG ) compared to placebo group ( PG ) . RESULTS	Between group analysis confirmed , at T1-T3 , significant differences between CG and PG in bloating and discomfort . CONCLUSIONS	Simethicone is an inert antifoaming able to reduce bloating , abdominal discomfort . CONCLUSIONS	Literature offers increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS and it is well known that probiotics are important to restore the native gut microbiota . CONCLUSIONS	The Colinox medical device is specifically targeted against most intrusive symptom of IBS ( bloating ) and it is also able to counteract the most accredited ethiopathogenetic factor in IBS ( alterations of intestinal microbiota ) . CONCLUSIONS	This is the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a combination of simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in treatment of IBS ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate feasibility and superiority of large liver hemangioma treated with laparoscopic microwave ablation . METHODS	Between March 2006 and May 2013 , 47 patients with liver hemangioma ( 5-10 cm ) were surgically treated in our department , and were randomly divided into three groups , laparoscopic microwave ablation group ( treatment group ) , traditional opening group , and laparoscopic resection group . METHODS	Three groups were compared in respect of postoperative ambulation time , gastrointestinal function recovery time , postoperative liver function recovery time , intraoperative blood loss , postoperative hospital stay , using SPSS13 .0 software and analysis of variance , P < 0.05 indicates significant , then adopting Student-Newman-Keuls method to compare mean value of every two groups . METHODS	And the treatment group of patients were tracked and reviewed . RESULTS	With regard to above aspects , treatment group and two control groups were compared , P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant , then the result of S-N-K method showed that the treatment group was far better than the control group in the above four areas , however compared with traditional opening group laparoscopic resection group did not demonstrate any superiority . RESULTS	Tracking the patients of treatment group proved no recurrence , and one case 's CT films before and after surgery were compared , further confirming the feasibility of microwave ablation . CONCLUSIONS	To large hepatic hemangioma , laparoscopic microwave ablation in respect of intraoperative injury , postoperative recovery and costs is superior to other methods , and the treatment effect is certain , it 's feasible and worthy of promotion ."
"BACKGROUND	A non-blinded , cluster randomised controlled trial to test whether footwear reduces prevalence and intensity of hookworm infection in school-aged children on Pemba Island , Zanzibar . METHODS	Six schools were randomised to receive shoes and standard care ( deworming with albendazole and health education ) and six control schools to receive standard care only . METHODS	Children provided a stool sample to assess prevalence and intensity of infection with soil transmitted helminthiases ( Ascaris lumbricoides , Trichuris trichiura and hookworm ) . METHODS	Shoes were then distributed to pupils in the intervention schools ; deworming took place as part of the government 's mass drug administration programme and a further round of stool samples were collected six months later . RESULTS	Nine hundred and fifteen children were traced at follow-up ( 1056 at baseline ) . RESULTS	As many children wore shoes in the control arm as the intervention arm . RESULTS	There was no difference in hookworm prevalence ( 23.4 % for intervention schools , 21.3 % for control schools , p = 0.48 ) , and no difference in mean hookworm infection in eggs/gram of stool ( 18 , 1-36 in intervention schools , 18 , 7-29 in control schools , p = 0.23 ) . RESULTS	Shoe-wearing increased across all schools , from 47.4 to 82.4 % . RESULTS	If a child wore shoes at the end of the study , the relative risk of hookworm infection was 0.7 ( CI 0.53-0 .91 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Due to contamination , the trial could not conclude that shoes were protective against hookworm infection but the intervention led to behavioural change , and observational data suggest that shoes are protective against hookworm . CONCLUSIONS	This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT01869127 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate whether anti-inflammatory doses of cyclosporine activate Toxoplasma gondii in chronically infected cats or potentiate infection in cats exposed for the first time . METHODS	30 T gondii-negative cats . METHODS	Cats were assigned to 1 of 3 groups ( 10 cats/group ) . METHODS	Group 1 ( control ) cats were administered a placebo for 126 days ; group 2 cats were administered a placebo for 84 days , followed by cyclosporine at 7.5 mg/kg/d , PO , for 42 days ; and group 3 cats were administered cyclosporine at 7.5 mg/kg/d , PO , for 126 days . METHODS	Cats were orally inoculated with T gondii on day 42 . METHODS	Results for fecal flotations , PCR assays , and histologic examinations and IgM and IgG titers were analyzed . METHODS	Cyclosporine concentrations were measured on selected days . RESULTS	All cats were infected by T gondii and developed signs of self-limiting gastrointestinal tract infection . RESULTS	Group 3 had the highest incidence and severity of CNS and pulmonary histopathologic findings typical of toxoplasmosis . RESULTS	One cat in group 3 died of systemic toxoplasmosis ; that cat had a cyclosporine concentration of 1,690 ng/mL . RESULTS	Group 2 cats infected with T gondii before cyclosporine administration did not have repeated oocyst shedding . RESULTS	Group 3 cats shed fewer oocysts for a shorter time than did control cats of group 1 . CONCLUSIONS	Oral administration of cyclosporine in accordance with the protocol for this study did not potentiate the enteroepithelial phase of T gondii infection . CONCLUSIONS	Cats with high cyclosporine blood concentrations at the time of primary T gondii infection may be at risk of developing systemic toxoplasmosis ."

"OBJECTIVE	The 47 integrin monoclonal antibody vedolizumab is hypothesised to be gut selective . OBJECTIVE	Effects of vedolizumab on immune responses to parenterally or enterally administered antigens were investigated . METHODS	In this randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase I trial , healthy participants received a single intravenous dose of vedolizumab 750mg ( n = 64 ) or placebo ( n = 63 ) . METHODS	After 4days , participants began intramuscular hepatitis B vaccine ( HBV ; days 4 , 32 , 60 ) and oral cholera vaccine ( OCV ; days 4 , 18 ) regimens . METHODS	The study was designed to demonstrate a 15 % non-inferiority margin for the between-group difference in the primary end point : percentage of participants with HBV seroconversion at day 74 ( serum hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBs ) antibody titre 10IU/L ) . METHODS	OCV seroconversion at day 74 ( > 4-fold increase in serum cholera toxin ( CT ) antibodies ) was a secondary end point . RESULTS	A total of 56 ( 90.3 % ) placebo-treated and 54 ( 88.5 % ) vedolizumab-treated participants responded to HBV . RESULTS	Geometric mean anti-HBs titres were similar for placebo ( 114.4 IU/L ) and vedolizumab ( 129.6 IU/L ) at day 74 . RESULTS	A total of 60 ( 96.8 % ) placebo-treated and 52 ( 82.5 % ) vedolizumab-treated participants responded to OCV at day 74 . RESULTS	Geometric mean anti-CT IgG levels were higher for placebo than for vedolizumab at day 74 ( 9210.08 vs. 3007.8 ELISA Units ( EU ) / mL ) and day 32 ( 11629.3 vs. 1575.4 EU/mL ) .

"BACKGROUND	Delivery of a pharmacologically effective drug dosage to a target tissue is critical . BACKGROUND	Barrett 's epithelia are a unique challenge for drug delivery of orally administered zinc due to rapid transit down the esophageal lumen , incomplete absorptive differentiation of these epithelia , and the use of proton-pump inhibitor drugs abrogating intestinal uptake of supplemental zinc . METHODS	Barrett 's esophagus patients were administered oral zinc gluconate ( 26 mg zinc twice daily ) for 14 days prior to biopsy procurement . METHODS	Barrett 's biopsies were analyzed for total zinc content by atomic absorption spectroscopy and by western immunoblot for cellular proteins known to be regulated by zinc . RESULTS	Cellular levels of both the Znt-1 transport protein and the alpha isoform of PKC were over 50 % lower in the zinc treatment group . CONCLUSIONS	Oral zinc administration can result in effective delivery of zinc to Barrett 's epithelia with resulting effects on intracellular signal transduction ."
"BACKGROUND	Green tea ( GT ) extract may play a role in body weight regulation . BACKGROUND	Suggested mechanisms are decreased fat absorption and increased energy expenditure . OBJECTIVE	We examined whether GT supplementation for 12 wk has beneficial effects on weight control via a reduction in dietary lipid absorption as well as an increase in resting energy expenditure ( REE ) . METHODS	Sixty Caucasian men and women [ BMI ( in kg/m ) : 18-25 or > 25 ; age : 18-50 y ] were included in a randomized placebo-controlled study in which fecal energy content ( FEC ) , fecal fat content ( FFC ) , resting energy expenditure , respiratory quotient ( RQ ) , body composition , and physical activity were measured twice ( baseline vs. week 12 ) . METHODS	For 12 wk , subjects consumed either GT ( > 0.56 g/d epigallocatechin gallate + 0.28-0 .45 g/d caffeine ) or placebo capsules . METHODS	Before the measurements , subjects recorded energy intake for 4 consecutive days and collected feces for 3 consecutive days . RESULTS	No significant differences between groups and no significant changes over time were observed for the measured variables . RESULTS	Overall means SDs were 7.2 3.8 g/d , 6.1 1.2 MJ/d , 67.3 14.3 kg , and 29.8 8.6 % for FFC , REE , body weight , and body fat percentage , respectively . CONCLUSIONS	GT supplementation for 12 wk in 60 men and women did not have a significant effect on FEC , FFC , REE , RQ , and body composition ."
"BACKGROUND	Patients with evidence of vascular disease are at increased risk for subsequent vascular events despite effective use of statins to lower the low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol level . BACKGROUND	Niacin lowers the LDL cholesterol level and raises the high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol level , but its clinical efficacy and safety are uncertain . METHODS	After a prerandomization run-in phase to standardize the background statin-based LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy and to establish participants ' ability to take extended-release niacin without clinically significant adverse effects , we randomly assigned 25,673 adults with vascular disease to receive 2 g of extended-release niacin and 40 mg of laropiprant or a matching placebo daily . METHODS	The primary outcome was the first major vascular event ( nonfatal myocardial infarction , death from coronary causes , stroke , or arterial revascularization ) . RESULTS	During a median follow-up period of 3.9 years , participants who were assigned to extended-release niacin-laropiprant had an LDL cholesterol level that was an average of 10 mg per deciliter ( 0.25 mmol per liter as measured in the central laboratory ) lower and an HDL cholesterol level that was an average of 6 mg per deciliter ( 0.16 mmol per liter ) higher than the levels in those assigned to placebo . RESULTS	Assignment to niacin-laropiprant , as compared with assignment to placebo , had no significant effect on the incidence of major vascular events ( 13.2 % and 13.7 % of participants with an event , respectively ; rate ratio , 0.96 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.90 to 1.03 ; P = 0.29 ) . RESULTS	Niacin-laropiprant was associated with an increased incidence of disturbances in diabetes control that were considered to be serious ( absolute excess as compared with placebo , 3.7 percentage points ; P < 0.001 ) and with an increased incidence of diabetes diagnoses ( absolute excess , 1.3 percentage points ; P < 0.001 ) , as well as increases in serious adverse events associated with the gastrointestinal system ( absolute excess , 1.0 percentage point ; P < 0.001 ) , musculoskeletal system ( absolute excess , 0.7 percentage points ; P < 0.001 ) , skin ( absolute excess , 0.3 percentage points ; P = 0.003 ) , and unexpectedly , infection ( absolute excess , 1.4 percentage points ; P < 0.001 ) and bleeding ( absolute excess , 0.7 percentage points ; P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Among participants with atherosclerotic vascular disease , the addition of extended-release niacin-laropiprant to statin-based LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of major vascular events but did increase the risk of serious adverse events . CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by Merck and others ; HPS2-THRIVE ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00461630 . )"
"BACKGROUND	Anal incontinence is a frequent complaint that profoundly affects quality of life . BACKGROUND	Our aim was to determine whether perineal retraining gives additional benefits to standard medical treatment . METHODS	Patients with anal incontinence and a Wexner score > 4 were randomly assigned to standard conservative treatment ( control ) or perineal retraining , including biofeedback , in addition to standard treatments ( biofeedback ) . METHODS	Diaries , self-administered questionnaires and satisfaction scores quantified the benefits . METHODS	Self-evaluated improvement was the primary outcome measure . METHODS	A score 3 ( in an improvement scale from -5 to +5 ) defined success . RESULTS	Overall , 157 patients were included ; 80 in the control group ( 75 % females , mean age 60.1 13.2 years ) and 77 in the biofeedback group ( 79 % females , mean age 61.9 10.2 years ) . RESULTS	After a 4-month follow-up , the success rate was significantly higher in the biofeedback group ( 57 % versus 37 % ; p < 0.021 ) . RESULTS	In the biofeedback group , daily stool frequency , leakage , and faecal urgency significantly decreased , and daily non-urgent perception of stool increased . RESULTS	Conversely , symptomatic scores and quality of life scales did not significantly differ between groups . RESULTS	In a multivariate model , the adjusted odds ratio showed that perineal retraining was significantly associated with a higher chance of self-rated improvement ( adjusted Odd Ratio [ 95 % CI ] : 2.34 [ 1.14-4 .80 ] ; p = 0.021 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Perineal retraining offers a moderate but significant benefit for patients suffering from anal incontinence ."
"BACKGROUND	Cytotoxic chemotherapy is widely used for advanced , unresectable pancreatic and other gastrointestinal foregut neuroendocrine tumours ( NETs ) and the most commonly used regimen combines 5-fluorouracil with streptozocin . BACKGROUND	The NET01 trial was designed to investigate whether capecitabine combined with streptozocin was an acceptable regimen with or without adding cisplatin . METHODS	Patients with advanced , unresectable NETs of pancreatic , gastrointestinal foregut or unknown primary site were randomised to receive three-weekly capecitabine ( Cap ) 625 mg/m ( 2 ) twice daily orally , streptozocin ( Strep ) 1.0 g/m ( 2 ) intravenously on day 1 , with or without cisplatin ( Cis ) 70 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously on day 1 . METHODS	The primary outcome measure was objective response . METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included progression-free and overall survival , quality of life , toxicity and biochemical response . RESULTS	86 ( 44 CapStrep , 42 CapStrepCis ) patients were randomised . RESULTS	Best objective response rate was 12 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 2-22 % ) with CapStrep and 16 % ( 95 % CI = 4-27 .4 % ) with CapStrepCis . RESULTS	Disease-control rate was 80 % with CapStrep and 74 % with CapStrepCis . RESULTS	The estimated median progression-free and overall survival were 10.2 and 26.7 months for CapStrep and 9.7 and 27.5 months for CapStrepCis . RESULTS	44 % of CapStrep and 68 % of CapStrepCis patients experienced grade 3 adverse events . CONCLUSIONS	The efficacies of the novel CapStrepCis regimens were very similar . CONCLUSIONS	CapStrep was better tolerated than CapStrepCis . CONCLUSIONS	The trial was registered as EudraCT : 2004-005202-71 and ISRCTN : 35124268 ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early feeding after cesarean delivery under different anesthetic methods . METHODS	Two hundred women with elective cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to early oral feeding ( EOF ) or routine oral feeding ( ROF ) groups . METHODS	EOF patients were informed that they could begin taking fluids orally ( regime I ) as soon as 2 hours after the delivery and then gradually progress to solid foods ( regime III ) , if tolerated . METHODS	ROF patients were informed that they could start regime I right after bowel sounds were heard on examination and then gradually move on to regime III . METHODS	Hospitalization time and total time to ambulation ( primary outcomes ) , gasstool discharge time and onset of bowel sounds ( secondary outcomes ) were compared in groups A [ EOF patients after regional anesthesia ( n = 49 ) } , B [ EOF patients after general anesthesia ( n = 48 ) } , C [ ROF patients after regional anesthesia ( n = 47 ) } and 0 [ ROF patients after general anesthesia ( n = 48 ) ] . RESULTS	There were significant differences in primary and secondary outcomes between group A and the remaining groups , especially group D. RESULTS	The status of patients from group B was not better than group C. RESULTS	In fact , the latter were discharged home sooner and passage of gas , as well as initiation of regime I occurred earlier as compared to the former CONCLUSIONS	Cesarean section under regional anesthesia and encouragement of oral feeding 2 hours after the operation should be recommended in order to acnieve postoperative recovery and early hospital discharge . CONCLUSIONS	Routine oral feeding ( right after bowel sounds are heard on examination ) after cesarean section under general anesthesia should be the last choice ."
"BACKGROUND	Novel sensory inputs for the control of food intake and gastrointestinal ( GI ) function are of increasing interest due to the rapid increase in nutrition-related diseases . BACKGROUND	The essential amino acid L-lysine was demonstrated to have a selective impact on food intake , gastric emptying , and intestinal transit in rats , thus indicating a potential novel direct sensory input to assess dietary protein content and quality . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to assess translational aspects of this finding and to investigate the dose-dependent effect of L-lysine on human and rat GI function . METHODS	L-lysine doses from 0-800 mg in rats and 0.5-7 .5 g in humans were analyzed for their effect on gastric emptying and GI secretion . METHODS	Human GI function was assessed non-invasively using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , rat data were acquired using standard lethal measurement methods . METHODS	L-lysine dose dependently delayed gastric emptying and stimulated GI secretion in rats as reflected by residual phenol red content and increased gastric wet weight . RESULTS	The dose-dependent delay in gastric emptying observed in rats was confirmed in humans with an increase in halftime of gastric emptying of 4 min/g L-lysine , p < 0.01 . RESULTS	Moreover , a dose-dependent increase in intestinal fluid accumulation was observed ( 0.4 mL/min/g L-lysine , p < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	No effect on alkaline tide , glucose concentration , hematocrit , or visceral sensations was detected . CONCLUSIONS	This translational study demonstrates comparable dose-dependent effects of intragastric L-lysine on GI function in humans and rats and suggests a broader role for individual amino acids in the control of GI motility and secretion in vivo ."
"OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the effect of probiotic intervention using lactobacilli on oral malodor . METHODS	We conducted a 14-day , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized crossover trial of tablets containing Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 ( 2.0 10 ( 9 ) colony-forming units per day ) or placebo taken orally by patients with oral malodor . RESULTS	Organoleptic test scores significantly decreased in both the probiotic and placebo periods compared with the respective baseline scores ( P < .001 and P = .002 ) , and no difference was detected between periods . RESULTS	In contrast , the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds ( VSCs ) ( P = .019 ) and the average probing pocket depth ( P = .001 ) decreased significantly in the probiotic period compared with the placebo period . RESULTS	Bacterial quantitative analysis found significantly lower levels of ubiquitous bacteria ( P = .003 ) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ( P = .020 ) in the probiotic period . CONCLUSIONS	These results indicated that daily oral consumption of tablets containing probiotic lactobacilli could help to control oral malodor and malodor-related factors ."
"OBJECTIVE	A number of simulators have been developed to teach surgical trainees the basic skills required to effectively perform laparoscopic surgery ; however , consideration needs to be given to how well the skills taught by these simulators are maintained over time . OBJECTIVE	This study compared the maintenance of laparoscopic skills learned using box trainer and virtual reality simulators . METHODS	Participants were randomly allocated to be trained and assessed using either the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery ( FLS ) simulator or the Surgical Science virtual reality simulator . METHODS	Once participants achieved a predetermined level of proficiency , they were assessed 1 , 3 , and 6 months later . METHODS	At each assessment , participants were given 2 practice attempts and assessed on their third attempt . METHODS	The study was conducted through the Simulated Surgical Skills Program that was held at the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons , Adelaide , Australia . RESULTS	Overall , 26 participants ( 13 per group ) completed the training and all follow-up assessments . RESULTS	There were no significant differences between simulation-trained cohorts for age , gender , training level , and the number of surgeries previously performed , observed , or assisted . RESULTS	Scores for the FLS-trained participants did not significantly change over the follow-up period . RESULTS	Scores for LapSim-trained participants significantly deteriorated at the first 2 follow-up points ( 1 and 3 months ) ( p < 0.050 ) , but returned to be near initial levels by the final follow-up ( 6 months ) . CONCLUSIONS	This research showed that basic laparoscopic skills learned using the FLS simulator were maintained more consistently than those learned on the LapSim simulator . CONCLUSIONS	However , by the final follow-up , both simulator-trained cohorts had skill levels that were not significantly different to those at proficiency after the initial training period ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the safety and satisfaction of patients treated 14 days after unilateral bunionectomy with extended-release oxycodone/acetaminophen ( ER OC/APAP ) , a biphasic ( ER and immediate release ) fixed-dose combination analgesic being developed for moderate to severe acute pain . METHODS	This was an open-label extension ( OLE ) of a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ( DBRCT ) of patients undergoing bunionectomy . METHODS	Patients who consented to the OLE before entering the 48 hour DBRCT entered the OLE upon completing the DBRCT and during the OLE received two tablets of ER OC/APAP ( 15/650mg total dose ) every 12 hours for 14 days . METHODS	ClinicalTrials identifier : NCT01484652 . METHODS	Treatment-emergent adverse events , physical examinations , vital sign measurements , and clinical laboratory testing were assessed throughout the study . METHODS	Global assessments of treatment satisfaction were made at the end of the DBRCT and at each clinic visit during the OLE . RESULTS	A total of 146 patients consented to the OLE before entering the DBRCT and 129 completed the OLE . RESULTS	Tolerability of ER OC/APAP during the OLE was consistent with that of an opioid product . RESULTS	Adverse events occurred during the OLE in 64 patients ( 43.8 % ) ; the most common were gastrointestinal events including nausea ( 17.8 % ) , vomiting ( 7.5 % ) , and constipation ( 6.2 % ) . RESULTS	No changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory tests were considered by the investigator to be clinically significant . RESULTS	At all visits during the OLE , the majority of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with their medication . RESULTS	Limitations include a 14 day postprocedure study duration that may be confounded with natural healing time , and lack of a placebo arm . CONCLUSIONS	These results show that ER OC/APAP demonstrated an expected safety and tolerability profile and good patient satisfaction in a postsurgical model of acute pain ."

METHODS	The incidence of postoperative infectious complication was collected and compared as well . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in immune indexes and insulin resistance-associated indexes between the two groups before operation and on the day 3 after operation ( all P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	On postoperative day 7 , CD4 ( + ) , CD4 ( + ) / CD8 ( + ) and NK cells in treatment group were significantly higher than those in control group [ ( 39.14.3 ) % vs. ( 30.15.7 ) % , P = 0.043 ; 1.760.21 vs. 1.360.12 , P = 0.038 ; ( 19.34.8 ) % vs. ( 13.33.2 ) % , P = 0.032 ] , while FINS , lnHOMA-IR and PCT in treatment group were significantly lower than those in control group [ ( 7.31.7 ) mU/L vs. ( 10.22.1 ) mU/L , P = 0.041 ; 0.600.05 vs. 0.880.06 , P = 0.039 ; ( 0.120.07 ) g/L vs. ( 0.350.12 ) g/L , P = 0.028 ] . RESULTS	Postoperative infectious complication morbidity was significantly lower in treatment group as compared to control group [ 18.8 % ( 9/48 ) vs. 39.6 % ( 19/48 ) , P = 0.025 ] . CONCLUSIONS	Microbial immune enteral nutrition composed of probiotics , deep sea fish oil , glutamine and nutrison can improve the immune status , decrease the level of insulin resistance , and reduce the incidence of postoperative infectious complication for patients with abdominal infection due to upper gastrointestinal perforation ."
"BACKGROUND	The effect of eating speed at a meal on appetite gut hormone responses and future food consumption is not clear . BACKGROUND	This study examined the effect of eating speed at breakfast on postprandial gut hormone responses , subjective appetite , and daily food consumption . METHODS	Twenty-five participants [ 68 % men ; age , 25.9 ( 8.1 ) years ; body mass index , 25.0 ( 3.2 ) kg/m ] were recruited . METHODS	Each participant consumed the same breakfast at a slow ( 30 minutes ) and fast ( 10 minutes ) speed , on 2 separate days , in a randomized crossover design . METHODS	Blood samples were collected in the fasting state and 3 hours postprandially during each eating condition . METHODS	Appetite was assessed over the same period using visual analog scales . METHODS	Blood concentrations of orexigenic hormone , ghrelin , and anorexigenic hormones , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) and peptide YY ( PYY ) , were determined . METHODS	Daily food intake was measured , by food recall , after the slow and fast breakfast . RESULTS	Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis showed no eating condition or eating condition by time interaction effect on ghrelin , GLP-1 , PYY , hunger , or fullness . RESULTS	Significant eating speed by time interaction effect on desire to eat was found ( P = 0.007 ) . RESULTS	Desire to eat was lower at 60 minutes ( P = 0.007 ) after breakfast began during the slow versus fast eating condition . RESULTS	Eating speed at breakfast did not affect daily energy and macronutrient intake . CONCLUSIONS	Eating speed at breakfast did not affect postprandial ghrelin , GLP-1 , PYY , hunger , and fullness values or daily energy and macronutrient intake . CONCLUSIONS	Desire to eat was lower at 60 minutes in the slow versus fast eating condition , but this result could not be explained by the changes in meal-related hormones measured in the study ."
"BACKGROUND	Infant formulae are being supplemented with probiotics , prebiotics , or symbiotic despite uncertainties regarding their efficacy . BACKGROUND	Mexican agave is an interesting source of fructans with particular features and with potential prebiotic effects . METHODS	RCT in 600 healthy term babies ( 20 7 days ) , allocated to receive standard infant formula ( control ) or infant formula added with a dual prebiotic system `` Metlin and Metlos '' , from Mexican agave . METHODS	Primary outcomes include stools frequency , stools consistency , gastrointestinal intolerance ( frequency of abdominal distension , flatulency , regurgitations , vomiting ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include changes on weight and height along the study and frequency of dermatologic problems ( eczema ) . RESULTS	In 66,120 days of total follow-up , there were no differences on the frequency of stools passage ( Human Milk : 3.8 2.4 evacuations per day ; Pro + Metlin + Metlos 3.6 2.0 ; Pro + Metlin 3.6 2 ; only Pro 3.4 2.3 only formula 3.4 2.0 ; p NS ) . RESULTS	Consistency of stools was similar between human milk and prebiotics supplemented groups . RESULTS	Also the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was significantly low between these groups . CONCLUSIONS	Fructans derivate from agave and added to infant formula are safe and well tolerated by Mexican healthy term babies ."
"OBJECTIVE	Weight loss after pharmacotherapy varies greatly . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to examine associations of quantitative gastrointestinal and psychological traits with obesity , and to validate the ability of these traits to predict responses of obese individuals to pharmacotherapy . METHODS	In a prospective study , we measured gastric emptying of solids and liquids , fasting and postprandial gastric volume , satiation by nutrient drink test ( volume to fullness and maximal tolerated volume ) , satiety after an ad libitum buffet meal , gastrointestinal hormones , and psychological traits in 328 normal-weight , overweight , or obese adults . METHODS	We also analyzed data from 181 previously studied adults to assess associations betwecen a subset of traits with body mass index and waist circumference . METHODS	Latent dimensions associated with overweight or obesity were appraised by principal component analyses . METHODS	We performed a proof of concept , placebo-controlled trial of extended-release phentermine and topiramate in 24 patients to validate associations between quantitative traits and response to weight-loss therapy . RESULTS	In the prospective study , obesity was associated with fasting gastric volume ( P = .03 ) , accelerated gastric emptying ( P < .001 for solids and P = .011 for liquids ) , lower postprandial levels of peptide tyrosine tyrosine ( P = .003 ) , and higher postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	In a combined analysis of data from all studies , obesity was associated with higher volume to fullness ( n = 509 ; P = .038 ) and satiety with abnormal waist circumference ( n = 271 ; P = .016 ) . RESULTS	Principal component analysis identified latent dimensions that accounted for approximately 81 % of the variation among overweight and obese subjects , including satiety or satiation ( 21 % ) , gastric motility ( 14 % ) , psychological factors ( 13 % ) , and gastric sensorimotor factors ( 11 % ) . RESULTS	The combination of phentermine and topiramate caused significant weight loss , slowed gastric emptying , and decreased calorie intake ; weight loss in response to phentermine and topiramate was significantly associated with calorie intake at the prior satiety test . CONCLUSIONS	Quantitative traits are associated with high body mass index ; they can distinguish obesity phenotypes and , in a proof of concept clinical trial , predicted response to pharmacotherapy for obesity . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov Number : NCT01834404 ."
"BACKGROUND	Gut dysfunctions may be associated to digestive symptoms . BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that the gut can also originate pleasant sensations , and wished to demonstrate the hedonic component of the digestive response to a meal . METHODS	Healthy subjects ( n = 42 ) were evaluated during basal fasting conditions and during experimentally induced fullness sensation ( either by gastric distension or duodenal nutrient infusion ) . METHODS	In each set of studies , a 240 mL test meal ( 12 kcal broth ) and water , as inert control meal , were administered on separate days in a randomized , cross-over design . METHODS	Gastric accommodation , the cognitive response and the hedonic dimension ( both by 10 score scales ) were measured 9 min before and 60 min after the meal . RESULTS	In basal conditions , the test meal induced a significantly greater gastric relaxation than the control meal ( 166 28 mL isotonic volume increase 67 14 mL ; p = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	Both meals induced epigastric fullness ( 3.8 0.7 score and 3.2 0.8 score , respectively ; p = 0.740 ) , but contrary to the inert meal , with the active meal this conscious sensation had a pleasant dimension ( digestive comfort increase by 1.3 0.6 score with active meal vs -1.1 0.6 decrease with inert meal ; p = 0.015 ) . RESULTS	Experimentally induced fullness was associated to a decrease in digestive well-being or abdominal discomfort , which improved only after the active meal but not the inert meal . CONCLUSIONS	When appropriate conditions are met , the response to a meal includes a hedonic dimension involving pleasant sensation of digestive well-being ."
"OBJECTIVE	To explore the clinical efficacy of acupoint catgut embedding therapy on chronic pelvic cavity pain syndrome differentiated as kidney deficiency and stagnation of damp heat , and explore the impacts on plasma P substance ( SP ) , plasma beta-endorphin ( - EP ) . METHODS	One hundred and eighty cases were randomly divided into a catgut embedding group ( 90 cases ) and a western medication group ( 90 cases ) . METHODS	In the western medication group , tamsulosin capsules 0.2 mg were prescribed for oral administration , once a day ; indometacin sustained release tablets , 25 mg , three times a day . METHODS	Totally , the oral administration for 8 weeks was required . METHODS	In the catgut embedding group , the acupoint catgut embedding therapy was applied to Qugu ( CV 2 ) , Shenshu ( BL 23 ) , Zhibian ( BL 54 ) , Huiyin ( CV 1 ) and Sanyinjiao ( SP 6 ) , once every two weeks ; the treatment of 4 weeks made one session , and two sessions were required . METHODS	Before and after treatment , TCM symptom score , NIH-CPSI ( the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index ) score , lecithin body numbers in prostatic fluid , score in SAS ( self-rating anxiety scale ) , score in SDS ( self-rating depression scale ) , the levels of SP and - EP , etc. were observed in the two groups , and the clinical efficacy was assessed in the two groups . RESULTS	( 1 ) Ten cases were dropped in either group . RESULTS	The total effective rate was 91.25 % ( 73/80 ) in the catgut embedding group , higher than 78.75 % ( 63/80 ) in the western medication group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( 2 ) After treatment , TCM symptom score , total score in NIH-CPSI , pain score and the scores in SAS and SDS were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	After treatment , TCM symptom score , total score and pain score in NIH-CPSI , and the scores in SAS and SDS in the catgut embedding group were both lower than those in the western medication group ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( 3 ) After treatment , the lecithin body numbers were both increased as compared with those before treatment in the two groups ( both P < 0.05 ) , and the result in the catgut embedding group was higher than that in the western medication group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( 4 ) After treatment , the SP level was lower than that before treatment in the two groups ( both P < 0.05 ) ; the level of p-EP was increased as compared with that before treatment ( both P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The SP level in the catgut embedding group was lower than that in the western medication group ( P < 0.05 ) ; the level of - EP was higher than that in the western medication group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The acupoint catgut embedding therapy apparently relieves the clinical symptoms of chronic pelvic cavity pain syndrome differentiated as kidney deficiency and stagnation of damp heat as well as the condition of anxiety and depression , increases lecithin body numbers in prostatic fluid and - EP level and reduces SP level ."
"OBJECTIVE	Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) is a common cause of hospitalization in patients with cirrhosis . OBJECTIVE	Pharmacologic treatment for acute ( overt ) HE has remained the same for decades . OBJECTIVE	To compare polyethylene glycol 3350-electrolyte solution ( PEG ) and lactulose treatments in patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital for HE . OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that rapid catharsis of the gut using PEG may resolve HE more effectively than lactulose . METHODS	The HELP ( Hepatic Encephalopathy : Lactulose vs Polyethylene Glycol 3350-Electrolyte Solution ) study is a randomized clinical trial in an academic tertiary hospital of 50 patients with cirrhosis ( of 186 screened ) admitted for HE . METHODS	Participants were block randomized to receive treatment with PEG , 4-L dose ( n = 25 ) , or standard-of-care lactulose ( n = 25 ) during hospitalization . METHODS	The primary end point was an improvement of 1 or more in HE grade at 24 hours , determined using the hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm ( HESA ) , ranging from 0 ( normal clinical and neuropsychological assessments ) to 4 ( coma ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes included time to HE resolution and overall length of stay . RESULTS	A total of 25 patients were randomized to each treatment arm . RESULTS	Baseline clinical features at admission were similar in the groups . RESULTS	Thirteen of 25 patients in the standard therapy arm ( 52 % ) had an improvement of 1 or more in HESA score , thus meeting the primary outcome measure , compared with 21 of 23 evaluated patients receiving PEG ( 91 % ) ( P < .01 ) ; 1 patient was discharged before final analysis and 1 refused participation . RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) HESA score at 24 hours for patients receiving standard therapy changed from 2.3 ( 0.9 ) to 1.6 ( 0.9 ) compared with a change from 2.3 ( 0.9 ) to 0.9 ( 1.0 ) for the PEG-treated groups ( P = .002 ) . RESULTS	The median time for HE resolution was 2 days for standard therapy and 1 day for PEG ( P = .01 ) . RESULTS	Adverse events were uncommon , and none was definitely study related . CONCLUSIONS	PEG led to more rapid HE resolution than standard therapy , suggesting that PEG may be superior to standard lactulose therapy in patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for acute HE .

"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate via retrospective analysis the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol extended release ( ER ; 100-250 mg bid ) based on patient-specific factors , including baseline pain intensity , prior opioid experience , gender , and body mass index ( BMI ) . METHODS	Data were pooled from three randomized , double-blind phase III studies of similar design that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol ER for the management of moderate to severe , chronic osteoarthritis knee pain ( NCT00421928 , NCT00486811 ) or low back pain ( NCT00449176 ) . METHODS	In the original trials , patients were recruited at primary , secondary , and tertiary care centers , institutional settings , and private practices in North America , Europe , Australia , and New Zealand . METHODS	Data were analyzed separately for groups of patients divided by baseline pain intensity , prior opioid experience , gender , and BMI . METHODS	Patients received twice-daily placebo , tapentadol ER ( 100-250 mg ) , or oxycodone HCl controlled release ( CR ; 20-50 mg ) for a 3-week titration and 12-week maintenance period . METHODS	Changes from baseline in average pain intensity ( 11-point numerical rating scale ) at week 12 of the maintenance period and for the overall maintenance period . RESULTS	Efficacy and tolerability were evaluated in 2,968 and 2,974 patients , respectively . RESULTS	The efficacy of tapentadol ER was shown in subpopulations divided by baseline pain intensity , prior opioid experience , gender , and BMI . RESULTS	Tapentadol ER was also shown to be well tolerated and associated with better gastrointestinal tolerability than oxycodone CR in the evaluated subpopulations ( divided by prior opioid experience and gender ) . CONCLUSIONS	Results suggest that tapentadol ER ( 100-250 mg bid ) provides similar pain relief and tolerability , regardless of baseline pain intensity , prior opioid experience , gender , or BMI ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of Lactobacillus-containing commercially available probiotic formulations in Germany during antibiotic treatment with an analysis of cost-efficiency . METHODS	In an observational study , we analyzed the frequency of bowel movements from 258 patients with infections in a primary care hospital in western Germany ; 107 of the patients were offered a probiotic drink containing at least 10 billion cultures of Lactobacillus casei DN 114001 b.i.d. METHODS	The economic analysis was based on the costs of patient isolation vs preventive intake of probiotics . METHODS	In a second pilot study , two commercially available probiotic drinks with different Lactobacillus casei strains were directly compared in 60 patients in a randomized controlled fashion . RESULTS	In the first study , the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea ( AAD ) was significantly reduced in the intervention group ( 6.5 % vs 28.4 % ) , and the duration of AAD in days was significantly shorter ( 1.7 1.1 vs 3.1 2.1 ) . RESULTS	Higher age and creatinine and lower albumin were identified as risk factors for AAD . RESULTS	Ampicillin was the antibiotic with the highest rate of AAD ( 50 % ) and with the greatest AAD reduction in the probiotic group ( 4.2 % , relative risk reduction 92 % ) . RESULTS	The economic analysis showed a cost advantage of nearly 60000 / year in a department of this size . RESULTS	The second study confirmed the preventive effect of the drink with Lactobacillus casei DN114001 ; however , there were no advantages found for the other tested probiotic drink containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota . CONCLUSIONS	In contrast to a drink containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota , a commercially available probiotic drink containing Lactobacillus casei DN 114001 cost-efficiently reduces the prevalence of AAD during antibiotic treatment ."
"BACKGROUND	This is the first randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ( EUDRACT No. 2009-013923-43 ) evaluating nickel oral hyposensitizing treatment ( NiOHT ) in patients with `` systemic nickel allergy syndrome '' ( SNAS ) , characterized by Ni-allergic contact dermatitis and systemic reactions after eating Ni-rich food . METHODS	Adults with positive Ni-patch test , who reported symptoms suggesting SNAS , which improved after Ni-poor diet , and were positive to Ni-oral challenge were eligible . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to three treatments ( 1.5 g , 0.3 g , or 30 ng Ni/week ) or placebo for a year , with progressive reintroduction of Ni-rich foods form the 5 ( th ) month . METHODS	Out of 141 patients randomized , 113 completed the trial . METHODS	Endpoints were efficacy and tolerability of treatment . RESULTS	During Ni-rich food re-introduction , the 1.5 g Ni/week group had a mean VAS score significantly higher than placebo ( p = 0.044 ) , with significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms ( p = 0.016 ;) and significantly fewer rescue medications . RESULTS	Cutaneous manifestations also improved but without reaching statistical significance . RESULTS	After the treatment , oral challenge with higher Ni doses than at baseline were needed to cause symptoms to flare-up in significantly more patients given 1.5 g Ni/week than placebo ( p = 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Patients reported no side-effects . CONCLUSIONS	NiOHT is effective in SNAS , in particular on gastrointestinal manifestations , with trend toward improvement of cutaneous symptoms ."
"BACKGROUND	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world . BACKGROUND	Oral administration of synbiotic has been proposed as an effective treatment of NAFLD because of its modulating effect on the gut flora , which can influence the gut-liver axis . OBJECTIVE	The objective was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with synbiotic on hepatic fibrosis , liver enzymes , and inflammatory markers in patients with NAFLD . METHODS	In a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted as a pilot study , 52 patients with NAFLD were supplemented twice daily for 28 wk with either a synbiotic or a placebo capsule . METHODS	Both groups were advised to follow an energy-balanced diet and physical activity recommendations . RESULTS	At the end of the study , the alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) concentration decreased in both groups ; this reduction was significantly greater in the synbiotic group . RESULTS	At the end of the study , the following significant differences [ means ( 95 % CIs ) ] were seen between the synbiotic and placebo groups , respectively : ALT [ -25.1 ( -26.2 , -24 ) compared with -7.29 ( -9.5 , -5.1 ) IU/L ; P < 0.001 ] , aspartate aminotransferase [ -31.33 ( -32.1 , -30.5 ) compared with -7.94 ( -11.1 , -4.8 ) IU/L ; P < 0.001 ] , - glutamyltransferase [ -15.08 ( -15.5 , -14.7 ) compared with -5.21 ( -6.6 , -3.9 ) IU/L ; P < 0.001 ] , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ -2.3 ( -3 , -1.5 ) compared with -1.04 ( -1.5 , -0.6 ) mmol/L ; P < 0.05 ] , tumor necrosis factor - [ -1.4 ( -1.7 , -1.1 ) compared with -0.59 ( -0.8 , -0.3 ) mmol/L ; P < 0.001 ] , total nuclear factor - B p65 [ -0.016 ( -0.022 , -0.011 ) compared with 0.001 ( -0.004 , -0.007 ) mmol/L ; P < 0.001 ] , and fibrosis score as determined by transient elastography [ - 2.98 ( -3.6 , -2.37 ) compared with -0.77 ( -1.32 , -0.22 ) kPa ; P < 0.001 ] . CONCLUSIONS	Synbiotic supplementation in addition to lifestyle modification is superior to lifestyle modification alone for the treatment of NAFLD , at least partially through attenuation of inflammatory markers in the body . CONCLUSIONS	Whether these effects will be sustained with longer treatment durations remains to be determined ."
"BACKGROUND	The prevalence of male obesity is increasing but few men take part in weight loss programmes . BACKGROUND	We assessed the effect of a weight loss and healthy living programme on weight loss in football ( soccer ) fans . METHODS	We did a two-group , pragmatic , randomised controlled trial of 747 male football fans aged 35-65 years with a body-mass index ( BMI ) of 28 kg/m ( 2 ) or higher from 13 Scottish professional football clubs . METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned with SAS ( version 92 , block size 2-9 ) in a 1:1 ratio , stratified by club , to a weight loss programme delivered by community coaching staff in 12 sessions held every week . METHODS	The intervention group started a weight loss programme within 3 weeks , and the comparison group were put on a 12 month waiting list . METHODS	All participants received a weight management booklet . METHODS	Primary outcome was mean difference in weight loss between groups at 12 months , expressed as absolute weight and a percentage of their baseline weight . METHODS	Primary outcome assessment was masked . METHODS	Analyses were based on intention to treat . METHODS	The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials , number ISRCTN32677491 . RESULTS	374 men were allocated to the intervention group and 374 to the comparison group . RESULTS	333 ( 89 % ) of the intervention group and 355 ( 95 % ) of the comparison group completed 12 month assessments . RESULTS	At 12 months the mean difference in weight loss between groups , adjusted for baseline weight and club , was 494 kg ( 95 % CI 395-594 ) and percentage weight loss , similarly adjusted , was 436 % ( 364-508 ) , both in favour of the intervention ( p < 00001 ) . RESULTS	Eight serious adverse events were reported , five in the intervention group ( lost consciousness due to drugs for pre-existing angina , gallbladder removal , hospital admission with suspected heart attack , ruptured gut , and ruptured Achilles tendon ) and three in the comparison group ( transient ischaemic attack , and two deaths ) . RESULTS	Of these , two adverse events were reported as related to participation in the programme ( gallbladder removal and ruptured Achilles tendon ) . CONCLUSIONS	The FFIT programme can help a large proportion of men to lose a clinically important amount of weight ; it offers one effective strategy to challenge male obesity . BACKGROUND	Scottish Government and The UK Football Pools funded delivery of the programme through a grant to the Scottish Premier League Trust . BACKGROUND	The National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research Programme funded the assessment ( 09/3010/06 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Safety of individual probiotic strains approved under Investigational New Drug ( IND ) policies in cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy ( MHE ) is not clear . OBJECTIVE	The primary aim of this phase I study was to evaluate the safety , tolerability of probiotic Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) compared to placebo , while secondary ones were to explore its mechanism of action using cognitive , microbiome , metabolome and endotoxin analysis in MHE patients . METHODS	Cirrhotic patients with MHE patients were randomised 1:1 into LGG or placebo BID after being prescribed a standard diet and multi-vitamin regimen and were followed up for 8 weeks . METHODS	Serum , urine and stool samples were collected at baseline and study end . METHODS	Safety was assessed at Weeks 4 and 8 . METHODS	Endotoxin and systemic inflammation , microbiome using multi-tagged pyrosequencing , serum/urine metabolome were analysed between groups using correlation networks . RESULTS	Thirty MHE patients ( 14 LGG and 16 placebo ) completed the study without any differences in serious adverse events . RESULTS	However , self-limited diarrhoea was more frequent in LGG patients . RESULTS	A standard diet was maintained and LGG batches were comparable throughout . RESULTS	Only in the LGG-randomised group , endotoxemia and TNF - decreased , microbiome changed ( reduced Enterobacteriaceae and increased Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XIV and Lachnospiraceae relative abundance ) with changes in metabolite/microbiome correlations pertaining to amino acid , vitamin and secondary BA metabolism . RESULTS	No change in cognition was found . CONCLUSIONS	In this phase I study , Lactobacillus GG is safe and well-tolerated in cirrhosis and is associated with a reduction in endotoxemia and dysbiosis ."
"BACKGROUND	Helicobacter pylori ( H pylori ) is strongly associated with the development of gastritis , duodenal and gastric ulcers , gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphomas and gastric carcinoma . BACKGROUND	Emerging antibiotic resistance and patients ' poor compliance with modern therapies have resulted in increasing eradication failure . OBJECTIVE	The current trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of current quadruple and phytomedicine-based therapies for the eradication of H pylori infection and relief of its associated symptoms in Pakistan . METHODS	The study was a randomized , controlled , multicenter clinical trial . METHODS	Setting The study was conducted in high-risk areas of Pakistan , including at Shifa-Ul-Mulk Memorial Hospital in Karachi , at Bahawalpur Victoria Hospital in Bahawalpur , and at Nawaz Salik Hospital in Rawalpindi . METHODS	The study enrolled 210 patients who tested positive for H pylori , 118 males and 92 females . METHODS	Participants were divided into 2 groups according to treatment regimens . METHODS	One group of participants received quadruple therapy-20 mg of omeprazole , 1g of amoxicillin , 500 mg of metronidazole , and 400 mg of bismuth compound-that was prescribed for 7 d , and another group received an alternate , phytomedicine-based , quadruple formulation-500 mg of Pylorex Plus-that was prescribed for 15 d. METHODS	The eradication rate for H pylori was the primary outcome measure . METHODS	Eradication was considered to be achieved on the basis of a negative C-urea breath test ( UBT ) and a negative stool antigen test for H pylori ( HpSAg ) at 4 wk after the end of treatment . METHODS	The secondary outcome measure was the improvement in the clinical features as assessed by dyspepsia scores . RESULTS	In an intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis , the study found that H pylori was eradicated in 56 of the 90 participants in the quadruple therapy group who completed the study ( 62.2 % ) and in 48 of the 86 participants in the Pylorex Plus group who completed the study ( 55.8 % ) . RESULTS	Therefore , Pylorex Plus had an eradication rate comparable with quadruple therapy . RESULTS	However , Pylorex Plus had significantly reduced gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms at the second wk and at 1 mo after treatment , both for participants in whom H pylori was eradicated and for those in whom it was not eradicated . RESULTS	The quadruple therapy group also showed reduced GI symptoms at the second wk and at 1 mo after treatment , but that result occurred only for those participants in whom H pylori was eradicated , and no significant improvement was observed for participants in whom it was not eradicated . CONCLUSIONS	Current quadruple and alternate therapies yielded poor eradication rates ( < 70 % ) , but the latter produced marked symptomatic improvement , both for participants in whom H pylori was eradicated and for those in whom it was not eradicated , pointing out its potential use with patients with functional dyspepsia ( FD ) who are both positive and negative for H pylori ."
"BACKGROUND	The Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) is a measure of disease activity based on symptoms , signs and a laboratory test . BACKGROUND	The US Food and Drug Administration has indicated that patient reported outcomes ( PROs ) should be the primary outcome in randomised controlled trials for Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . OBJECTIVE	As no validated PRO exists for CD , to investigate whether CDAI diary card items could be modified for this purpose . METHODS	Data from a trial of rifaximin-extended intestinal release were used to identify cut-points for stool frequency , pain and general well-being using receiver operating characteristic curves with CDAI < 150 as criterion . METHODS	The operating properties of 2 - and 3-item PRO were evaluated using data from a trial of methotrexate in CD . METHODS	Regression analysis determined PRO2 and PRO3 scores that correspond to CDAI-defined thresholds of 150 , 220 and 450 and changes of 50 , 70 and 100 points . RESULTS	Optimum cut-points for CDAI remission were mean daily stool frequency 1.5 , abdominal pain 1 , and general well-being score of 1 ( areas under the ROC curve 0.79 , 0.91 and 0.89 , respectively ) . RESULTS	The effect estimates were similar using 2 - and 3-item PROs or CDAI . RESULTS	PRO2 and PRO3 values corresponding to CDAI scores of 150 , 220 and 450 points were 8 , 14 , 34 and 13 , 22 , 53 . RESULTS	The corresponding values for CDAI changes of 50 , 70 and 100 , were 2 , 5 , 8 and 5 , 9 , 14 . RESULTS	Responsiveness to change was similar for both PROs . CONCLUSIONS	Patient reported outcomes derived from CDAI diary items may be appropriate for use in clinical trials for CD ."
"BACKGROUND	Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis . BACKGROUND	BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation , whereas the `` fishy odor '' test is always positive . BACKGROUND	In contrast , aerobic vaginitis ( AV ) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli , but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved . BACKGROUND	Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics , although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli . BACKGROUND	The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier , thus facilitating relapses and recurrences . BACKGROUND	This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli , thus identifying a possible use in AV . BACKGROUND	The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria . METHODS	For this purpose , neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5 % to 4 % to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231 . METHODS	The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention , placebo-controlled , pilot trial involving 34 female subjects ( aged between 18 and 50 , mean 34.78.9 , no menopausal women ) diagnosed with BV . METHODS	The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 ( DSM 26955 ) and L. plantarum LP01 ( LMG P-21021 ) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets , also containing 50 mg of tara gum . METHODS	The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose . METHODS	The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights , followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application ( acute phase ) and , finally , 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences . METHODS	A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment ( d0 ) , after 28 days ( d28 ) , and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention ( d56 ) . METHODS	A statistical comparison was made between d28 , or d56 , and d0 , and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences . RESULTS	L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours . RESULTS	In the human trial , the 2 lactobacilli selected , namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 , significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group ( 91.7 % , P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Eight women ( 33.3 % ) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6 , evidence of an intermediate situation , whereas the remaining 14 ( 58.3 % ) showed a score < 4 , therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota . RESULTS	At the end of the second month , only 4 women registered a Nugent score > 7 , definable as BV ( 16.7 % , P = 0.065 compared with d28 ) . RESULTS	In the placebo group , no significant differences were recorded at any time . CONCLUSIONS	BV , also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , BV is often asymptomatic as about 50 % of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10 % . CONCLUSIONS	This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women . CONCLUSIONS	This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum , which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , long-term physiological protection seems to be established , thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa . CONCLUSIONS	In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli , their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting ."
"BACKGROUND	We aimed to evaluate clinical symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome receiving Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial . METHODS	Overall , 179 adults with irritable bowel syndrome ( Rome III criteria ) were randomized to receive once daily 500 mg of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , delivered by one capsule ( n = 86 , F : 84 % , age : 42.5 12.5 ) , or placebo ( n = 93 , F : 88 % , age : 45.4 14 ) for 8 weeks followed by a 3-week washout period . METHODS	After a 2-week run-in period , cardinal symptoms ( abdominal pain/discomfort , bloating/distension , bowel movement difficulty ) and changes in stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily and assessed each week . METHODS	A safety assessment was carried out throughout the study . RESULTS	The proportion of responders , defined by an improvement of abdominal pain/discomfort , was significantly higher ( p = 0.04 ) in the treated group than the placebo group ( 63 % vs 47 % , OR = 1.88 , 95 % , CI : 0.99-3 .57 ) in the last 4 weeks of treatment . RESULTS	A non-significant trend of improvement was observed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the other symptoms . RESULTS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae was well tolerated and did not affect stool frequency and consistency . CONCLUSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well tolerated and reduces abdominal pain/discomfort scores without stool modification . CONCLUSIONS	Thus , Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be a new promising candidate for improving abdominal pain in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome ."
"BACKGROUND	Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) is the gold standard technique for en bloc resection of large superficial tumors in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract . BACKGROUND	Little is known about the management of epigastric pain after ESD of gastric neoplasms . BACKGROUND	This study investigated the utility and safety of single-dose , perioperative , intravenous dexamethasone for epigastric pain relief following ESD . METHODS	The efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg ( DEXA group ) compared with saline-only placebo ( placebo ) for epigastric pain after ESD of early gastric neoplasms was assessed in a double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial . METHODS	Patients completed a questionnaire about present pain intensity ( PPI ) and short-form McGill pain ( SF-MP ) categories for immediate and 6 - , 12 - , and 24-h postoperative periods . METHODS	The primary outcome variable was PPI at 6 h following ESD . METHODS	Secondary outcome variables included pain medication , SF-MP scores , complications , second-look endoscopic findings , and length of stay . RESULTS	A total of 36 patients participated in the study . RESULTS	The mean 6-h PPI value was lower ( p < 0.001 ) in the DEXA group ( 1.61 0.21 ) than in the placebo group ( 2.66 0.19 ) . RESULTS	The total 6-h SF-MP score , especially the sensory domain , was higher ( p = 0.054 ) in the placebo group ( 11.56 0.75 ) than in the DEXA group ( 8.89 0.75 ) . RESULTS	Tramadol for epigastric pain relief was more frequent ( p = 0.026 ) in the placebo group ( 44.4 % ) than in the DEXA group ( 11.1 % ) . RESULTS	No differences were noted between groups in length of stay or complications , including acute or delayed bleeding . RESULTS	The distribution of artificial ulcer patterns at 48-h post-ESD as determined by second-look endoscopy was similar in both groups . CONCLUSIONS	Single-dose perioperative intravenous dexamethasone after ESD effectively relieved epigastric pain 6 h postoperatively ."
"OBJECTIVE	Both corticosteroid and pentoxifylline reduce short-term mortality in severe alcoholic hepatitis . OBJECTIVE	However , few studies have directly compared the efficacy of pentoxifylline and corticosteroid in patients with this condition . METHODS	In this multicentre , open-labelled , randomised non-inferiority trial , we assigned 121 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis ( Maddrey 's discriminant function 32 ) to receive either pentoxifylline ( 400 mg , 3 times daily , in 62 subjects ) or prednisolone ( 40 mg daily , in 59 subjects ) . METHODS	The primary end point was non-inferiority in survival at the 1 month time point for the pentoxifylline treatment compared with prednisolone . RESULTS	The 1-month survival rate of patients receiving pentoxifylline was 75.8 % ( 15 deaths ) compared with 88.1 % ( 7 deaths ) in those , taking prednisolone , for a treatment difference of 12.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval , -4.2 % to 28.7 % ; p = 0.08 ) . RESULTS	The 95 % confidence interval for the observed difference exceeded the predefined margin of non-inferiority ( 15 % ) and included zero . RESULTS	The 6-month survival rate was not significantly different between the pentoxifylline and prednisolone groups ( 64.5 % vs. 72.9 % ; p = 0.23 ) . RESULTS	At 7 days , the response to therapy assessed by the Lille model was significantly lower in the prednisolone group ( n = 58 ) than in the pentoxifylline group ( n = 5 9 ) : 0.35 vs. 0.50 ( p = 0.012 ) . RESULTS	Hepatitis complications , including hepatorenal syndrome and side effects , such as infection and gastrointestinal bleeding , were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	The findings demonstrate that the efficacy of the pentoxifylline is not statistically equivalent to the efficacy of prednisolone , supporting the use of prednisolone as a preferred treatment option in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis ."
"BACKGROUND	The potential for transmission of infectious diseases offered by the school environment are likely to be an important contributor to the rates of infectious disease experienced by children . BACKGROUND	This study aimed to test whether the addition of hand sanitiser in primary school classrooms compared with usual hand hygiene would reduce illness absences in primary school children in New Zealand . RESULTS	This parallel-group cluster randomised trial took place in 68 primary schools , where schools were allocated using restricted randomisation ( 1:1 ratio ) to the intervention or control group . RESULTS	All children ( aged 5 to 11 y ) in attendance at participating schools received an in-class hand hygiene education session . RESULTS	Schools in the intervention group were provided with alcohol-based hand sanitiser dispensers in classrooms for the winter school terms ( 27 April to 25 September 2009 ) . RESULTS	Control schools received only the hand hygiene education session . RESULTS	The primary outcome was the number of absence episodes due to any illness among 2,443 follow-up children whose caregivers were telephoned after each absence from school . RESULTS	Secondary outcomes measured among follow-up children were the number of absence episodes due to specific illness ( respiratory or gastrointestinal ) , length of illness and illness absence episodes , and number of episodes where at least one other member of the household became ill subsequently ( child or adult ) . RESULTS	We also examined whether provision of sanitiser was associated with experience of a skin reaction . RESULTS	The number of absences for any reason and the length of the absence episode were measured in all primary school children enrolled at the schools . RESULTS	Children , school administrative staff , and the school liaison research assistants were not blind to group allocation . RESULTS	Outcome assessors of follow-up children were blind to group allocation . RESULTS	Of the 1,301 and 1,142 follow-up children in the hand sanitiser and control groups , respectively , the rate of absence episodes due to illness per 100 child-days was similar ( 1.21 and 1.16 , respectively , incidence rate ratio 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.94 to 1.18 ) . RESULTS	The provision of an alcohol-based hand sanitiser dispenser in classrooms was not effective in reducing rates of absence episodes due to respiratory or gastrointestinal illness , the length of illness or illness absence episodes , or the rate of subsequent infection for other members of the household in these children . RESULTS	The percentage of children experiencing a skin reaction was similar ( 10.4 % hand sanitiser versus 10.3 % control , risk ratio 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.78 to 1.30 ) . RESULTS	The rate or length of absence episodes for any reason measured for all children also did not differ between groups . RESULTS	Limitations of the study include that the study was conducted during an influenza pandemic , with associated public health messaging about hand hygiene , which may have increased hand hygiene among all children and thereby reduced any additional effectiveness of sanitiser provision . RESULTS	We did not quite achieve the planned sample size of 1,350 follow-up children per group , although we still obtained precise estimates of the intervention effects . RESULTS	Also , it is possible that follow-up children were healthier than non-participating eligible children , with therefore less to gain from improved hand hygiene . RESULTS	However , lack of effectiveness of hand sanitiser provision on the rate of absences among all children suggests that this may not be the explanation . CONCLUSIONS	The provision of hand sanitiser in addition to usual hand hygiene in primary schools in New Zealand did not prevent disease of severity sufficient to cause school absence .

"BACKGROUND	Naturally occurring gastrointestinal disease is an important cause of acute hypoproteinemia in adult horses and hydroxyethyl starch colloid fluid treatment is a component of supportive care in these cases to improve plasma volume and maintain colloid osmotic pressure ( COP ) . BACKGROUND	The objectives of the present study were to compare 2 formulations of high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch and their relative effect on COP , acid-base status , and survival of horses with acute hypoproteinemia secondary to gastrointestinal disease . METHODS	Twenty adult horses , 1 year of age , were prospectively enrolled , with informed client consent , if they developed acute hypoproteinemia , defined as a plasma total protein < 5.0 g/dL or albumin < 2.2 g/dL during hospitalization while undergoing treatment for gastrointestinal disease . METHODS	Horses were randomly assigned to receive a rapid infusion of either 6 % hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9 % saline or 6 % hydroxyethyl starch in lactated ringers solution at a dose of 10 ml/kg . METHODS	Venous blood gas analysis , COP , and PCV were evaluated before and after colloid administration . RESULTS	For both groups , average COP prior to treatment was 11.0 mmHg ( 9.7 - 12.2 mmHg ) and post colloid treatment was 13.2 mmHg ( 12.0 -14.7 mmHg ) [ Normal range 18 - 22 mmHg ] . RESULTS	COP was significantly increased with colloid treatment ( p < 0.001 ) but this increase was not significantly different between treatment groups . RESULTS	Venous pH did not change significantly with treatment . RESULTS	Twelve horses survived to hospital discharge and survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups . CONCLUSIONS	Post-treatment COP improved approximately 20 % regardless of the formulation used , however , values did not reach the normal range of COP observed in healthy horses . CONCLUSIONS	Acid-base parameters were not significantly impacted by either treatment . CONCLUSIONS	Further study is needed to determine how these two products compare with regards to other outcome measures . CONCLUSIONS	Evaluation of the relative effects of colloid formulation in horses with clinical disease is a future area of interest ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the cardiorespiratory parametes , recovery , gastrointestinal motility and serum cortisol concentrations in horses anesthetized with isoflurane with or without a continuous rate infusion ( CRI ) of butorphanol for orchiectomy . METHODS	Twelve adult , intact , male horses weighing 332 55 kg were included in the study . METHODS	Xilazine was administered as premedication . METHODS	Anesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam and maintained with isoflurane . METHODS	Butorphanol ( 0.025 mg kg-1 bolus ) or an equivalent volume of saline ( 0.9 % ) was given intravenously followed by a CRI of butorphanol ( BG ) ( 13 g kg-1 hour-1 ) or saline ( CG ) . METHODS	Cardiorespiratory variables were recorded before ( T0 ) and every 15 minutes for 75 minutes after the start of infusion . METHODS	Serum cortisol concentration was measured at T0 and 60 minutes , and 30 minutes and 19 hours after the horse stood up . METHODS	Recovery from anesthesia was evaluated using a scoring system . METHODS	Gastrointestinal motility was evaluated before anesthesia and during 24 hours after recovery . RESULTS	There were no significant differences between groups in cardiopulmonary variables , or recovery scores or serum cortisol concentrations . RESULTS	A reduction in gastrointestinal motility was recorded for 60 minutes in BG . CONCLUSIONS	Continuous rate infusion of butorphanol in horses anesthetized with isoflurane did not adversely affect the cardiopulmonary variables monitored , or recovery scores . CONCLUSIONS	A small but statistically significant reduction in gastrointestinal motility occurred in the butorphanol group ."
"OBJECTIVE	To observe the protective effect of Xuebijing injection pretreatment on hepatic ischemia reperfusion ( I/R ) injury and coagulopathy in liver cancer patients undergoing excision of hepatic cancer after occlusion of hepatic blood flow . METHODS	A prospective randomly controlled study was conducted . METHODS	Sixty patients with liver cancer classified as Child-Pugh class A undergoing hepatectomy in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from October 2011 to March 2013 were enrolled . METHODS	The patients were randomized into control group and Xuebijing group ( each patient received 100 mL Xuebijing injection added to 0.9 % saline as a preoperative treatment for 3 days ) . METHODS	Complete blood count , coagulation function , hepatic function , serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) levels were determined before and after operation . RESULTS	Forty-five out of 60 patients were enrolled eventually , with 23 patients in control group and 22 in Xuebijing group , and among them 43 patients were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) at admission . RESULTS	Compared with those before operation , the postoperative levels of alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) in control and Xuebijing groups were significantly elevated , prothrombin time ( PT ) and activated partial prothrombin time ( AfYIT ) were significantly prolonged , and white blood cells ( WBC ) , proportion of neutrophils ( N ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) were significantly increased ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Although the above indexes in Xuebijing group after operation were lower than those in control group in different degrees [ ALT ( U/L ) : 213.1 ( 80.4-796 .6 ) vs. 265.8 ( 15.6-882 .3 ) , AST ( UIL ) : 194.1 ( 65.4-914 .2 ) vs. 264.3 ( 15.4-475 .9 ) , LDH ( lg , U/L ) : 5.69 0.72 vs. 5.71 0.72 , PT ( s ) : 15.24 2.16 vs. 14.41 1.33 , AfYIT ( s ) : 31.51 7.04 vs. 29.47 4.90 , WBC ( x 109/L ) : 13.4 7 4.66 vs. 14.58 4.40 , N : 0.87 0.06 vs. 0.87 0.04 , CRP ( mg/L ) : 40.64 ( 16.93-189 .59 ) vs. 45.64 ( 1.65-349 .40 ) J , no statistical significance was found between the groups ( all P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The preoperative levels of tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF - a ) and interleukin-6 OL-6 ) were both less than 1.0 ng/L , and the postoperative levels of TNF-a showed no significant change , and IL-6 was increased to 485.10 ( 104.00-837 .50 ) ng/L and 193.26 ( 95.10-385 .20 ) ng/L in control and Xuebijing groups respectively ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	The serum high mobility group box-1 ( HMGB1 ) protein levels after operation were higher than those of preoperative in both groups ( both P < 0.01 ) , but the postoperative HMGB1 in Xuebijing group were significantly lower than those in control group ( j.Lg / L : 268.73 5.56 vs. 277.12 2.92 , P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ll ( APACHE ll ) score in Xuebijing group was significantly lower than that in control group ( 4.18 3.75 vs. 4.53 2.34 , t = 5.328 , P = 0.027 ) , and the first passage of flatus and defecation after operation in Xuebijing group were significantly earlier than those in control group [ exhaust time ( days ) : 3 ( 2-4 ) vs. 3 ( 2-4 ) , U = -2.023 , P = 0.043 ; defecation time ( days ) : 4 ( 2-6 ) vs. 5 ( 3-8 ) , U = -2.926 , P = 0.003 J. However , no difference was found between two groups in the postoperative and total hospital days . RESULTS	Spearman rank correlation analysis showed there were positive correlations between hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) - DNA levels and preoperative ALT ( r = 0.414 , P = 0.044 ) and AST ( r = 0.405 , P = 0.024 ) in 33 HBV-DNA positive patients , but there was no significant correlation between HBV - DNA levels or other preoperative liver function indicators . CONCLUSIONS	Hepatic I/R injury and coagulopathy may occur in liver cancer patients undergoing resection of cancer with occlusion of hepatic blood flow . CONCLUSIONS	Xuebijing injection may inhibit the release of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines , thereby alleviate hepatic I/R injury and promote the recovery of intestinal function . CONCLUSIONS	But it does not offer protective effect on coagulopathy ."
"BACKGROUND	Faecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) from healthy donors is considered an effective treatment against recurrent Clostridium difficile infection . OBJECTIVE	To study the effect of FMT via colonoscopy in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection compared to the standard vancomycin regimen . METHODS	In an open-label , randomised clinical trial , we assigned subjects with recurrent C. difficile infection to receive : FMT , short regimen of vancomycin ( 125mg four times a day for 3days ) , followed by one or more infusions of faeces via colonoscopy ; or vancomycin , vancomycin 125mg four times daily for 10days , followed by 125-500mg / day every 2-3days for at least 3weeks . METHODS	The latter treatment did not include performing colonoscopy . METHODS	The primary end point was the resolution of diarrhoea related to C. difficile infection 10weeks after the end of treatments . RESULTS	The study was stopped after a 1-year interim analysis . RESULTS	Eighteen of the 20 patients ( 90 % ) treated by FMT exhibited resolution of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea . RESULTS	In FMT , five of the seven patients with pseudomembranous colitis reported a resolution of diarrhoea . RESULTS	Resolution of C. difficile infection occurred in 5 of the 19 ( 26 % ) patients in vancomycin ( P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	No significant adverse events were observed in either of the study groups . CONCLUSIONS	Faecal microbiota transplantation using colonoscopy to infuse faeces was significantly more effective than vancomycin regimen for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection . CONCLUSIONS	The delivery of donor faeces via colonoscopy has the potential to optimise the treatment strategy in patients with pseudomembranous colitis ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of the daily ingestion of a mixture of probiotics on the amount of Streptococcus mutans in the oral cavity of preschool-age patients with a high risk of caries . METHODS	Forty patients , aged between 4 and 6 years , with a high risk of dental caries were included in this pilot study . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to two study groups : the Experimental Group ( A ) included patients who brushed their teeth and used fluoridated toothpaste in addition to consuming probiotics daily , and the Control Group ( B ) inclused patients who brushed their teeth and used fluoridated toothpaste but did not consume probiotics . METHODS	Using the CariScreen , the microorganism count was determined at different times : baseline , 7 , 14 , 21 and 30 days . METHODS	To identify the differences between both groups , a Mann-Whitney U test was performed , with a significance level of 0.05 . RESULTS	It was observed that both groups showed similar microbial counts at the beginning of the trial ( p > 0.05 ) , and a significant decrease in the count at the end of the study was found in the experimental group ( p < 0.05 ) 15 days after suspending ingestion . CONCLUSIONS	We found a significant reduction of RLU values in preschool children who ingested the tested probiotics in relation to the baseline values and 15 days after ceasing consumption ."
"BACKGROUND	Discriminating neoplastic from non-neoplastic polyps can significantly reduce the cost of colonoscopy . BACKGROUND	The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) recently set threshold levels for optical diagnostic accuracy to be acceptable for clinical use . OBJECTIVE	In this study , we compare a novel colonoscope capable of dual-focus imaging with standard colonoscopy with respect to the ASGE guidelines . METHODS	An academic medical center ambulatory surgical center . METHODS	Patients at average risk were randomized to standard colonoscopy ( Olympus CF-H180 and Exera II 180 colonoscopes , Olympus America , Center Valley , Pa ) or dual-focus colonoscopy ( Olympus CF-HQ190 and Exera III 190 colonoscopes , Olympus America ) . METHODS	All polyps were given an optical diagnosis and compared with histology . RESULTS	A total of 600 patients were consented and 522 completed all aspects of the procedure . RESULTS	A total of 927 polyps were analyzed . RESULTS	Optical diagnostic accuracy was 79 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 74 % -83 % ) for the 190 and 77 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 73 % -81 % ) for the 180 colonoscope . RESULTS	Adenoma detection rates were also similar between the 2 groups ( 50 % for the 190 vs 52 % for the 180 colonoscope ) . RESULTS	For small distal rectosigmoid polyps with a high confidence diagnosis , the negative predictive value for adenoma was 96 % ( range 89 % -99 % ) for the 180 in the narrow-band imaging ( NBI ) mode and 97 % ( range 88 % -99 % ) for the 190 colonoscope in NBI mode . RESULTS	Agreement of surveillance intervals by using optical diagnosis was 94 % to 95 % for all modalities ( 180 and 190 colonoscopes , white light imaging , NBI ) . CONCLUSIONS	Our study evaluated the accuracy of the 180 and 190 colonoscopes at a center with already-established expertise in endoscopic imaging . CONCLUSIONS	Both traditional and new dual-focus colonoscopes provide highly accurate optical polyp discrimination . CONCLUSIONS	There was no difference between the 2 systems in terms of discrimination or adenoma detection . CONCLUSIONS	Both systems are consistent with ASGE guidelines for optical diagnosis of selected colorectal polyps without histological confirmation ."
"OBJECTIVE	Fat-soluble vitamin ( FSV ) deficiency is a well-recognized consequence of cholestatic liver disease and reduced intestinal intraluminal bile acid . OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that serum bile acid ( SBA ) would predict biochemical FSV deficiency better than serum total bilirubin ( TB ) level in infants with biliary atresia . METHODS	Infants enrolled in the Trial of Corticosteroid Therapy in Infants with Biliary Atresia after hepatoportoenterostomy were the subjects of this investigation . METHODS	Infants received standardized FSV supplementation and monitoring of TB , SBA , and vitamin levels at 1 , 3 , and 6 months . METHODS	A logistic regression model was used with the binary indicator variable insufficient/sufficient as the outcome variable . METHODS	Linear and nonparametric correlations were made between specific vitamin measurement levels and either TB or SBA . RESULTS	The degree of correlation for any particular vitamin at a specific time point was higher with TB than with SBA ( higher for TB in 31 circumstances vs 3 circumstances for SBA ) . RESULTS	Receiver operating characteristic curve shows that TB performed better than SBA ( area under the curve 0.998 vs 0.821 ) . RESULTS	Including both TB and SBA did not perform better than TB alone ( area under the curve 0.998 ) . CONCLUSIONS	We found that TB was a better predictor of FSV deficiency than SBA in infants with biliary atresia . CONCLUSIONS	The role of SBA as a surrogate marker of FSV deficiency in other cholestatic liver diseases , such as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis , -1 - antitrypsin deficiency , and Alagille syndrome in which the pathophysiology is dominated by intrahepatic cholestasis , warrants further study ."
"OBJECTIVE	The level of mutans streptococci ( MS ) is reduced by regularly consumption of probiotic Kefir drink . OBJECTIVE	The present study aiming at answer to this question ` may the Kefir drink be considered an alternative to fluoride rinse ? ' METHODS	Twenty-two healthy volunteers aged 22-32 years with good oral hygiene participated in this study . METHODS	None of participants had received any antibiotic or antimicrobial agent or professional fluoride therapy within the last month . METHODS	None of them exhibited active caries lesions . METHODS	Smokers and subjects who have chewing gums xylitol habit or who were undergoing orthodontic treatment were excluded . METHODS	In a cross over design with 2 parallel groups , people in group A for 2 weeks received 100 ml of Kefir drink per day , then avoided brushing , eating and drinking for an hour . METHODS	Simultaneously , people in group B were administered 0.05 % sodium fluoride rinse in the same manner . METHODS	After washout period , people in groups A and B respectively used 0.05 % sodium fluoride rinse and Kefir drink . METHODS	Saliva sampling was performed before and after interventions . METHODS	The acidity and the count of MS were assessed and data were analyzed statistically . RESULTS	There was no significant difference between base line pH values of saliva in study groups ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Although , a significant difference was shown between MS counts before and after interventions ( p 0.0001 and p 0.0001 for NaF and Kefir respectively ) , but the equal inhibitory effect was found between study groups ( p > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Kefir drink can inhibit salivary MS as well the sodium fluoride rinse . CONCLUSIONS	This beverage may be considered an alternative for fluoride rinse . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical significance : Probiotics containing dairy products was known with anticariogenic properties . CONCLUSIONS	These agents may be used in caries control strategies adjunctively ."
"BACKGROUND	Alvimopan is indicated to accelerate the time to gastrointestinal recovery following partial bowel resection with primary anastomosis . BACKGROUND	The approved dosing regimen includes an initial dose prior to surgery and 12 mg twice daily after surgery for up to 7 days ; however , there are no human studies evaluating the need for the preoperative dose . BACKGROUND	We report our experience with gastrointestinal recovery when the preoperative dose is omitted . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of alvimopan therapy when the preoperative dose is not administered . METHODS	This retrospective study included elective surgery patients who underwent bowel resection with primary anastomosis without colostomy or ileostomy . METHODS	The study compared ( a ) patients who received alvimopan and received a dose preoperatively , ( b ) patients who received alvimopan but did not receive a dose preoperatively , and ( c ) matched control patients who did not receive alvimopan . METHODS	Length of stay following bowel resection , direct hospital costs , time to first bowel movement , and time to oral diet were evaluated . RESULTS	Of 50 patients who received alvimopan , 27 received the preoperative dose and 23 did not . RESULTS	These 50 patients were matched to similar control patients who received no alvimopan during their admission for resection . RESULTS	Compared with controls , time to discharge was significantly shorter in patients who received alvimopan , regardless of whether the preoperative dose was administered ( P < .001 ) or omitted ( P = .03 ) . RESULTS	Patients who did not receive the preoperative dose still experienced faster time to first bowel movement ( 71 vs 97 hours ; P = .006 ) and faster time to first diet ( 17 vs 54 hours ; P < .001 ) than non-alvimopan users . CONCLUSIONS	Patients receiving the approved alvimopan dosing regimen experienced the most rapid recovery of gastrointestinal function . CONCLUSIONS	However , administering alvimopan only postoperatively ( if the preoperative dose is omitted ) may still reduce the severity of postoperative ileus ."
"OBJECTIVE	To observe the clinical efficacy of Tongfu Mixture ( TM ) for post-ERCP pancreatitis ( PEP ) . METHODS	Totally 54 PEP patients were randomly assigned to the control group ( treated by routine therapy , 26 cases ) and the TM treatment group ( treated by TM , 28 cases ) . METHODS	Clinical indices including the alleviation time of abdominal pain/distention , gastrointestinal function recovery time , and the post-surgical length of stay were observed . METHODS	Blood amylase ( AMY ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , plasma endotoxin ( PLS ) , TNF-alpha , and IL-6 were detected before surgery , 12 h , 48 h , and 96 h after surgery . RESULTS	The alleviation time of abdominal pain/distention , the gastrointestinal function recovery time , and the post-surgical length of stay were obviously shorter in the TM treatment group than those in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The recovery of AMY and CRP were better in the TM treatment group than in the control group at post-operative 48 h and 96 h ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The levels of LPS , TNF-alpha , and IL-6 were lower in the TM group than in the control group at post-operative 96 h ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	TM showed better clinical efficacy and could significantly decrease the post-surgical length of stay . CONCLUSIONS	post-ERCP pancreatitis ; integrative medicine ; Tongfu Mixture"
"OBJECTIVE	Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease . OBJECTIVE	The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 ( EcN ) has been used to maintain and induce clinical remission in UC . OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to test the effect of Ciprofloxacin and/or orally administered EcN as add-on to conventional therapies in patients with active UC . METHODS	Our single center double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study included patients with a Colitis Activity Index ( CAI ) score of at least 6 . METHODS	Patients were randomized to Ciprofloxacin or placebo for 1week followed by EcN or placebo for 7weeks . METHODS	All 4 treatments were given as add-on treatments . RESULTS	One hundred subjects with active UC were recruited . RESULTS	In the per-protocol analysis we , surprisingly , found that in the group receiving placebo/EcN fewer patients , 54 % , reached remission compared to the group receiving placebo/placebo , 89 % , p < 0.05 . RESULTS	Among patients treated with Cipro/placebo and Cipro/EcN , 78 % and 66 % reached remission , respectively . RESULTS	Furthermore , the group receiving placebo/EcN had the largest number of withdrawals , 11 of 25 ( 44 % ) , compared to 15 of 75 ( 20 % ) in any of the other groups , p < 0.05 . RESULTS	Indication of lack of mucosal healing was found in the group treated with placebo/Nissle , since only 4 ( 29 % ) of the 14 patients , who completed the study , reported no blood in stools at week 12 ( p < 0.02 ) , compared to 63 % , 67 % and 65 % in groups treated with Cipro/Nissle , Cipro/placebo and placebo/placebo , respectively . CONCLUSIONS	Our data suggest that there is no benefit in the use of E. coli Nissle as an add-on treatment to conventional therapies for active ulcerative colitis . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , treatment with E. coli Nissle without a previous antibiotic cure resulted in fewer patients reaching clinical remission ."
"OBJECTIVE	Antimicrobial prophylaxis is still a matter of debate in ear surgeries . OBJECTIVE	Previous studies have focused on prophylaxis in middle ear surgery alone without inclusion of mastoidectomy . OBJECTIVE	We therefore investigated efficacy of two regimes of antimicrobial prophylaxis in tympanoplasty with cortical mastoidectomy done for mild middle ear disease in chronic otitis media . METHODS	Prospective , randomized , controlled , double-blind study . METHODS	Patients undergoing tympanoplasty with cortical mastoidectomy were included and randomized into two study groups . METHODS	The group I patients received parenteral perioperative antimicrobials ; only group II patients received additional extended oral antimicrobials for 8 days more postoperatively . METHODS	Primary outcomes evaluated were postaural wound infection and graft success , assessed weekly until 1 month . METHODS	Adverse events and length of hospital stay were evaluated as secondary outcome . RESULTS	Seventy-eight patients were randomized into group I ( n = 39 ) and group II ( n = 39 ) . RESULTS	The two groups showed no difference in wound infection rate . RESULTS	The graft success rate in both the group was comparable ( 94.87 % in group I and 97.44 % in group II , respectively ; P = 1.00 ) . RESULTS	The length of hospital stay was significantly longer ( P = 0.00001 ) in group II ( 3.05 [ 0.72 ] , mean [ SD ] ) as compared to group I ( 2.36 [ 0.49 ] ) . RESULTS	During the first postoperative week , a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances were observed in group II ( 19 [ 48.72 % ] as compared to 1 [ 2.56 % ] in group I , P = 0.00001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The present study shows that there is no need of extended antimicrobial prophylaxis for tympanoplasty with cortical mastoidectomy done for mild middle ear disease . CONCLUSIONS	An indiscriminate use of antimicrobials may lead to increase incidence of adverse events and prolonged hospital stay . METHODS	1b ."
"BACKGROUND	Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening is cost-effective but underused . BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a mailed standard intervention ( SI ) and tailored navigation interventions ( TNIs ) to increase CRC screening use in the context of a randomized trial among primary care patients . METHODS	Participants ( n = 945 ) were randomized either to a usual care control group ( n = 317 ) , to an SI group ( n = 316 ) , or to a TNI group ( n = 312 ) . METHODS	The SI group was sent both colonoscopy instructions and stool blood tests irrespective of baseline preference . METHODS	TNI group participants were sent instructions for scheduling a colonoscopy , a stool blood test , or both based on their test preference , as determined at baseline ; then , they received a navigation telephone call . METHODS	Activity cost estimation was used to determine the cost of each intervention and to compute incremental cost-effectiveness ratios . METHODS	Statistical uncertainty within the base case was assessed with 95 % confidence intervals derived from net benefit regression analysis . METHODS	The effects of uncertain parameters , such as the cost of planning , training , and involvement of those receiving `` investigator salaries , '' were assessed with sensitivity analyses . RESULTS	Program costs of the SI were $ 167 per participant . RESULTS	The average cost of the TNI was $ 289 per participant . CONCLUSIONS	The TNI was more effective than the SI but substantially increased the cost per additional individual screened . CONCLUSIONS	Decision-makers need to consider cost structure , level of planning , and training required to implement these 2 intervention strategies and their willingness to pay for additional individuals screened to determine whether a tailored navigation would be justified and feasible ."
"BACKGROUND	Ipilimumab is an approved treatment for patients with advanced melanoma . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected stage III melanoma at high risk of recurrence . METHODS	We did a double-blind , phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma ( excluding lymph node metastasis 1 mm or in-transit metastasis ) with adequate resection of lymph nodes ( ie , the primary cutaneous melanoma must have been completely excised with adequate surgical margins ) who had not received previous systemic therapy for melanoma from 91 hospitals located in 19 countries . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) , centrally by an interactive voice response system , to receive intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab or placebo every 3 weeks for four doses , then every 3 months for up to 3 years . METHODS	Using a minimisation technique , randomisation was stratified by disease stage and geographical region . METHODS	The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival , assessed by an independent review committee , and analysed by intention to treat . METHODS	Enrollment is complete but the study is ongoing for follow-up for analysis of secondary endpoints . METHODS	This trial is registered with EudraCT , number 2007-001974-10 , and ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00636168 . RESULTS	Between July 10 , 2008 , and Aug 1 , 2011 , 951 patients were randomly assigned to ipilimumab ( n = 475 ) or placebo ( n = 476 ) , all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analyses . RESULTS	At a median follow-up of 274 years ( IQR 228-322 ) , there were 528 recurrence-free survival events ( 234 in the ipilimumab group vs 294 in the placebo group ) . RESULTS	Median recurrence-free survival was 261 months ( 95 % CI 193-393 ) in the ipilimumab group versus 171 months ( 95 % CI 134-216 ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio 075 ; 95 % CI 064-090 ; p = 00013 ) ; 3-year recurrence-free survival was 465 % ( 95 % CI 415-513 ) in the ipilimumab group versus 348 % ( 301-395 ) in the placebo group . RESULTS	The most common grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group were gastrointestinal ( 75 [ 16 % ] vs four [ < 1 % ] in the placebo group ) , hepatic ( 50 [ 11 % ] vs one [ < 1 % ] ) , and endocrine ( 40 [ 8 % ] vs none ) . RESULTS	Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 245 ( 52 % ) of 471 patients who started ipilimumab ( 182 [ 39 % ] during the initial treatment period of four doses ) . RESULTS	Five patients ( 1 % ) died due to drug-related adverse events . RESULTS	Five ( 1 % ) participants died because of drug-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group ; three patients died because of colitis ( two with gastrointestinal perforation ) , one patient because of myocarditis , and one patient because of multiorgan failure with Guillain-Barr syndrome . CONCLUSIONS	Adjuvant ipilimumab significantly improved recurrence-free survival for patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma . CONCLUSIONS	The adverse event profile was consistent with that observed in advanced melanoma , but at higher incidences in particular for endocrinopathies . CONCLUSIONS	The risk-benefit ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab at this dose and schedule requires additional assessment based on distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival endpoints to define its definitive value . BACKGROUND	Bristol-Myers Squibb ."
"OBJECTIVE	Hapatitis B visus ( CHB ) - induced fibrosis is a precancerous condition of liver . OBJECTIVE	To explore the influence of Chongcao Preparation ( Chongcao Yigan Capsule ) on the function of intestinal flora and chemoprevention for patients with CHB-induced liver fibrosis . METHODS	A total of 136 patients with CHB-induced liver fibrosis were randomly divided into control group treated with lamivudine ( LAM ) and research group added with Chongcao Yigan Capsule for totally 48 weeks . METHODS	The changes of intestinal flora , secretory immunoglobin A ( SIgA ) , serum albumin ( ALB ) , prealbumin ( PALB ) , IgA and IgG at different time points in both groups were observed . RESULTS	Before treatment , there was no significant difference between two groups in each index ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	After treatment , the intestinal flora were evidently optimized in research group than treatment before ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) , and were apparently better than those in control group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) ; SIgA was obviously increased and ALB , PALB , IgA and IgG were markedly improved in research group than treatment before ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) , and were significantly better than those in control group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Chongcao Yigan Capsule could regulate the intestinal flora , increase SIgA , serum ALB and PALB concentrations and significantly improve serum IgA and IgG as well as strengthen the immunological function and autologous repair capacity of patients with CHB-induced liver fibrosis ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of muscovite in preventing small bowel injury induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) . METHODS	We recruited and screened thirty-two healthy volunteers who were randomly allocated equally into two groups : an NSAID control group , who received 75 mg slow-release diclofenac , twice daily for 14 d ; and an NSAID-muscovite group , who received 3 g of muscovite in addition to the 75 mg of slow-release diclofenac , twice daily for 14 d. For gastroprotection , both groups were administered 20 mg/d of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole . METHODS	All eligible subjects underwent video capsule endoscopy ( CE ) prior to and 14 d after treatment . RESULTS	Thirty subjects ( NSAID-muscovite group , n = 16 ; NSAID control group , n = 14 ) finally completed the whole trail . RESULTS	At the baseline CE examination , no statistically significant differences between the two groups have been observed . RESULTS	However , after 14 d of drug treatment , a significant difference was observed in the percentage of subjects with mucosal breaks when comparing the NSAID-muscovite group with the NSAID control group . RESULTS	While 71.4 % ( 10/14 ) of subjects in the NSAID control group had at least one mucosal break , co-administration of muscovite in the NSAID-muscovite group reduced the rate to 31.3 % ( 5/16 ) ( P = 0.028 ) . RESULTS	Moreover , higher number of mucosal breaks was found in the NSAID control group vs that in the NSAID-muscovite group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Muscovite co-therapy reduced the incidence of small intestinal injury after 14 d of diclofenac administration ."
"OBJECTIVE	Cognitive-behavioral ( CB ) interventions improve outcomes for many pediatric health conditions , but little is known about which mechanisms mediate these outcomes . OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to identify whether changes in targeted process variables from baseline to 1 week posttreatment mediate improvement in outcomes in a randomized controlled trial of a brief CB intervention for idiopathic childhood abdominal pain . METHODS	Two hundred children with persistent functional abdominal pain and their parents were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions : a 3-session social learning and CB treatment ( N = 100 ) , or a 3-session educational intervention controlling for time and attention ( N = 100 ) . METHODS	Outcomes were assessed at 3 - , 6 - , and 12-month follow-ups . METHODS	The intervention focused on altering parental responses to pain and on increasing adaptive cognitions and coping strategies related to pain in both parents and children . RESULTS	Multiple mediation analyses were applied to examine the extent to which the effects of the social learning and CB treatment condition on child gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptom severity and pain as reported by children and their parents were mediated by changes in targeted cognitive process variables and parents ' solicitous responses to their child 's pain symptoms . RESULTS	Reductions in parents ' perceived threat regarding their child 's pain mediated reductions in both parent-reported and child-reported GI symptom severity and pain . RESULTS	Reductions in children 's catastrophic cognitions mediated reductions in child-reported GI symptom severity but no other outcomes . RESULTS	Reductions in parental solicitousness did not mediate outcomes . CONCLUSIONS	Results suggest that reductions in reports of children 's pain and GI symptoms after a social learning and CB intervention were mediated at least in part by decreasing maladaptive parent and child cognitions ."
"OBJECTIVE	Ramosetron is a new selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 ( 5-HT3 ) receptor antagonist that reportedly has more potent antiemetic effects than other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ramosetron pretreatment on gastric emptying using the 13C-acetic acid breath test . METHODS	Ten healthy male and female volunteers participated in this randomized , twoway crossover study . METHODS	After they had fasted overnight , the subjects were randomly assigned to receive 0.1 mg ramosetron 1 hour before ingestion of a test meal ( 200 kcal per 200 mL , containing 100 mg 13C acetate ) or to receive the test meal alone . METHODS	Under both conditions , breath samples were collected for 150 min following ingestion of the meal . METHODS	Statistical comparison of the parameters between the two test conditions was performed . RESULTS	No significant differences in the calculated parameters , including T 1/2 , T lag , GEC or and , were observed between the two test conditions . CONCLUSIONS	The present study revealed that 0.1 mg ramosetron had no significant effect on the rate of gastric emptying . CONCLUSIONS	Thus , our results suggest that ramosetron can be administered safely , without gastrointestinal adverse effects , even to terminal cancer patients with delayed or accelerated gastric emptying abnormality ."
"METHODS	Prospective randomized study . OBJECTIVE	To compare autologous bone marrow concentrate mixed with allograft cancellous bone to iliac crest autograft in lumbar fusions . BACKGROUND	Bone marrow has been shown to be a rich source of osteoprogenitor cells . BACKGROUND	Osteoprogenitor cells have been shown in animals , and some human studies , to have potential in use as a bone graft substitute . METHODS	Twenty-five patients underwent from 1 - to 3-level lumbar fusions . METHODS	One patient was lost to follow-up . METHODS	On one half of the spine , allograft plus autologous bone marrow concentrate was used , whereas on the other half , autologous iliac crest bone was used . METHODS	Cellular analysis , consisting of nucleated cell count , mononuclear cell count , CD34 + count , and colony-forming-units-fibroblast count , was done on marrow aspirates and concentrates . METHODS	At 1 year postoperation , computed tomographic scans of the fusions were evaluated on a blinded basis by 2 neuroradiologists independent of each other . METHODS	Radiographical fusion was the primary outcome measure . RESULTS	There was no statistical difference in fusion scores between allograft and autograft in the lateral gutters , interbody cages , or facet joints . RESULTS	There was a positive trend between CD34 + counts and radiographical fusion . CONCLUSIONS	The study shows equivalence between cancellous allograft mixed with bone marrow concentrate and autologous iliac crest bone for lumbar fusions . METHODS	2 ."
"BACKGROUND	Environmental enteric dysfunction ( EED ) is an acquired syndrome of impaired gastrointestinal mucosal barrier function that is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of stunting in early life . BACKGROUND	It has been conceptualized as an adaptive response to excess environmental pathogen exposure . BACKGROUND	However , it is clinically similar to other inflammatory enteropathies , which result from both host and environmental triggers , and for which immunomodulation is a cornerstone of therapy . METHODS	In this pilot double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial , 44 children with severe acute malnutrition and evidence of EED were assigned to treatment with mesalazine or placebo for 28 days during nutritional rehabilitation . METHODS	Primary outcomes were safety and acceptability of the intervention . RESULTS	Treatment with mesalazine was safe : there was no excess of adverse events , evidence of deterioration in intestinal barrier integrity or impact on nutritional recovery . RESULTS	There were modest reductions in several inflammatory markers with mesalazine compared to placebo . RESULTS	Depression of the growth hormone -- insulin-like growth factor-1 axis was evident at enrollment and associated with inflammatory activation . RESULTS	Increases in the former and decreases in the latter correlated with linear growth . CONCLUSIONS	Intestinal inflammation in EED is non-essential for mucosal homeostasis and is at least partly maladaptive . CONCLUSIONS	Further trials of gut-specific immunomodulatory therapies targeting host inflammatory activation in order to optimize the growth benefits of nutritional rehabilitation and to address stunting are warranted . CONCLUSIONS	Funded by The Wellcome Trust . BACKGROUND	Registered at Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01841099 ."
"BACKGROUND	A fixed-ratio combination of the basal insulin analogue insulin degludec and the glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) analogue liraglutide has been developed as a once-daily injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes . BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare combined insulin degludec-liraglutide ( IDegLira ) with its components given alone in insulin-naive patients . METHODS	In this phase 3 , 26-week , open-label , randomised trial , adults with type 2 diabetes , HbA1c of 7-10 % ( inclusive ) , a BMI of 40 kg/m ( 2 ) or less , and treated with metformin with or without pioglitazone were randomly assigned ( 2:1:1 ) to daily injections of IDegLira , insulin degludec , or liraglutide ( 18 mg per day ) . METHODS	IDegLira and insulin degludec were titrated to achieve a self-measured prebreakfast plasma glucose concentration of 4-5 mmol/L . METHODS	The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment , and the main objective was to assess the non-inferiority of IDegLira to insulin degludec ( with an upper 95 % CI margin of 03 % ) , and the superiority of IDegLira to liraglutide ( with a lower 95 % CI margin of 0 % ) . METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01336023 . RESULTS	1663 adults ( mean age 55 years [ SD 10 ] , HbA1c 83 % [ 09 ] , and BMI 312 kg/m ( 2 ) [ 48 ] ) were randomly assigned , 834 to IDegLira , 414 to insulin degludec , and 415 to liraglutide . RESULTS	After 26 weeks , mean HbA1c had decreased by 19 % ( SD 11 ) to 64 % ( 10 ) with IDegLira , by 14 % ( 10 ) to 69 % ( 11 ) with insulin degludec , and by 13 % ( 11 ) to 70 % ( 12 ) with liraglutide . RESULTS	IDegLira was non-inferior to insulin degludec ( estimated treatment difference -047 % , 95 % CI -058 to -036 , p < 00001 ) and superior to liraglutide ( -064 % , -075 to -053 , p < 00001 ) . RESULTS	IDegLira was generally well tolerated ; fewer participants in the IDegLira group than in the liraglutide group reported gastrointestinal adverse events ( nausea 88 vs 197 % ) , although the insulin degludec group had the fewest participants with gastrointestinal adverse events ( nausea 36 % ) . RESULTS	We noted no clinically relevant differences between treatments with respect to standard safety assessments , and the safety profile of IDegLira reflected those of its component parts . RESULTS	The number of confirmed hypoglycaemic events per patient year was 18 for IDegLira , 02 for liraglutide , and 26 for insulin degludec . RESULTS	Serious adverse events occurred in 19 ( 2 % ) of 825 patients in the IDegLira group , eight ( 2 % ) of 412 in the insulin degludec group , and 14 ( 3 % ) of 412 in the liraglutide group . CONCLUSIONS	IDegLira combines the clinical advantages of basal insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment , resulting in improved glycaemic control compared with its components given alone .

"OBJECTIVE	To study protective effect of ulinastatin on perioperative cardiac function in elderly patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery . METHODS	Sixty elderly patients ( 32 male and 28 female patients ) aged 60-82 years scheduled for major gastrointestinal surgery were randomized into ulinastatin group and control group . METHODS	The patients in ulinastatin group received 210 ( 5 ) U ulinastatin rapidly administered via a intravenous pump immediately before operation with subsequent continuous infusion at the rate of 110 ( 5 ) U until the completion of surgery , and those in the control group received the same amount of saline instead . METHODS	In both groups , the mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , and cardiac output ( CO ) were monitored immediately before surgery ( T0 ) and at 1 h ( T1 ) , 2 h ( T2 ) and 3 h ( T3 ) after the start of surgery . METHODS	The total dopamine dose used was recorded at the end of surgery , and blood samples were collected at T0 and at 6 h ( T4 ) and 12 h ( T5 ) after the operation for determination of serum levels of cTn , CK-MB and BNP . RESULTS	In both groups , MAP , LVEF and CO were significantly decreased at T2 and T3 ( P < 0.05 ) and serum levels of cTn , CK-MB and BNP significantly increased at T4 and T5 compared to those at T0 ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Compared with the control group , the patients in ulinastatin group showed significantly higher MAP , LVEF and CO at T2 and T3 and lower serum levels of cTn , CK-MB and BNP at T4 and T5 . CONCLUSIONS	Ulinastatin offers effective perioerative cardiac protection in elderly patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery ."
"BACKGROUND	Low-volume bowel preparations have been shown to provide an equivalent cleansing effect as that of a standard 4 L polyethylene glycol . BACKGROUND	However , studies comparing the efficacy of low-volume bowel preparations are few , and the results have been controversial . BACKGROUND	This study aimed to compare the bowel cleansing quality and tolerability between sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate and polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid . METHODS	A randomized study was performed with two hundred outpatients who were prospectively enrolled . METHODS	The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale and the Aronchick scale were used to evaluate the bowel cleansing quality , and bubble scoring was also performed to back up both results . METHODS	To investigate patients ' preferences and tolerability , a questionnaire was administered . RESULTS	Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate was not inferior to polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid in terms of successful bowel preparation ( 6 Boston scale score : 80 % vs. 82 % ; p = 0.718 , adequate Aronchick grade : 93 % vs. 96 % ; p = 0.352 ) . RESULTS	In addition , sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate caused fewer gastrointestinal symptoms , and tasted better than polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid . CONCLUSIONS	Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate was not inferior to polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid in cleansing efficacy , and was found to have higher tolerability ."
"OBJECTIVE	Methotrexate ( MTX ) is recognised as the cornerstone of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis . OBJECTIVE	For some patients , oral MTX demonstrates variable bioavailability , especially at higher doses . OBJECTIVE	Such concerns may be mitigated by subcutaneous ( SC ) MTX administration . OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the relative bioavailability , safety , and tolerability of MTX administered either by SC injection with a prefilled autoinjector pen ( MTX pen ) or orally . METHODS	This single-centre , open-label , randomised , 2-period , 2-sequence , single-dose , crossover study enrolled healthy subjects aged 18 to 55 years into 1 of 4 dose groups ( 7.5 mg , 15 mg , 22.5 mg , and 30 mg ) , where they received a single dose of SC MTX and of the oral MTX tablets . METHODS	Blood samples were collected from subjects predose and at prespecified time points postdose for pharmacokinetic analyses . METHODS	Adverse events ( AEs ) were recorded to assess differences in safety and tolerability . RESULTS	Bioavailability , as measured by maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) and area under the plasma-concentration curves ( AUC0-t ) , was generally higher with the SC MTX pen compared with oral administration for all dose groups . RESULTS	AUC0-t ratios increased with ascending doses ; Cmax ratios did not increase . RESULTS	A total of 80 AEs were reported in 35/62 subjects ; none were severe . RESULTS	Differences in the safety profiles were related to the route of administration . RESULTS	Single administrations with the MTX pen were well tolerated at the injection site . CONCLUSIONS	Single-dose administration with the SC MTX pen resulted in a higher relative bioavailability compared with oral administration . CONCLUSIONS	SC MTX pen administration was associated with fewer gastrointestinal AEs than oral MTX ."
"BACKGROUND	Postpartum haemorrhage can lead to iron deficiency with and without anaemia , the clinical consequences of which include physical fatigue . BACKGROUND	Although oral iron is the standard treatment , it is often associated with gastrointestinal side effects and poor compliance . BACKGROUND	To date , no published randomised controlled studies have compared the clinical efficacy and safety of standard medical care with intravenous administration of iron supplementation after postpartum haemorrhage.The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of an intravenous high single-dose of iron isomaltoside 1000 with standard medical care on physical fatigue in women with postpartum haemorrhage . METHODS	In a single centre , open-labelled , randomised trial , women with postpartum haemorrhage exceeding 700 mL will be allocated to either a single dose of 1,200 mg of iron isomaltoside 1000 or standard medical care . METHODS	Healthy parturients with a singleton pregnancy will be included within 48 hours after delivery.Participants will complete structured questionnaires that focus on several dimensions of fatigue and mental health ( Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory , Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Postpartum Questionnaire ) , at inclusion and at follow-up visits after three days , one week , three weeks , eight weeks , and 12 weeks postpartum . METHODS	The primary endpoint is the aggregated change in physical fatigue score within 12 weeks postpartum , as measured by a subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory . METHODS	The primary objective will be considered to have been met if an intravenous high single dose of iron isomaltoside 1000 is shown to be superior to standard medical care in women after postpartum haemorrhage regarding physical fatigue.For claiming superiority , we set the minimal clinically relevant difference between the mean scores at 1.8 , and the assumed standard deviation at 4.2 . METHODS	Hence , 87 participants per treatment group are needed in order to demonstrate superiority ; to provide an extra margin for missing data and dropouts , 200 women will be included . CONCLUSIONS	The study will provide evidence on relevant clinical outcomes beyond biochemical parameters for intravenous iron isomaltoside 1000 compared to standard medical care in women after postpartum haemorrhage . BACKGROUND	This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov ( identifier : NCT01895218 ) on 26 June 2013 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the influence of stroke volume variation ( SVV ) - based goal-directed therapy ( GDT ) on splanchnic organ functions and postoperative complications in orthopedic patients . METHODS	Eighty patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of two equal groups to receive either intraoperative volume therapy guided by SVV ( GDT ) or standard fluid management ( control ) . METHODS	In the SVV group , patients received colloid boluses of 4 ml/kg to maintain an SVV < 10 % when in the supine position or an SVV < 14 % if prone . METHODS	In the control group , fluids were given to maintain a mean arterial pressure > 65 mm Hg , a heart rate < 100 bpm , a central venous pressure of 8-14 mm Hg , and a urine output > 0.5 ml/kg/h . METHODS	Intraoperative organ perfusion , hemodynamic data , hospitalization , postoperative complications , and mortality were recorded . RESULTS	The heart rate at the end of surgery was significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) , there were fewer hypotensive episodes ( p < 0.05 ) , the arterial and gastric intramucosal pH were higher ( p < 0.05 for both ) , the gastric intramucosal PCO2 was lower ( p < 0.05 ) , the intraoperative infused colloids and the total infused volume were lower ( p < 0.05 for both ) , and the postoperative time to flatus was shorter ( p < 0.05 ) in the GDT group than in the control group . RESULTS	No differences in the length of hospital stay , complications , or mortality were found between the groups . CONCLUSIONS	SVV-based GDT during major orthopedic surgery reduced the volume of the required intraoperative infused fluids , maintained intraoperative hemodynamic stability , and improved the perioperative gastrointestinal function ."
"BACKGROUND	Evidence supports a role of 42 receptors in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . METHODS	This Korean , multicenter , double-blind , two-period ( 6 weeks each ) , crossover study randomized participants to the order in which they received varenicline ( 1 mg twice daily ) and placebo . METHODS	Assessments included AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) 75 , Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) , adverse events ( AEs ) and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) . RESULTS	For varenicline versus placebo ( n = 66 randomized ) , there was no significant difference in the week 6 least square ( LS ) mean ADAS-Cog 75 total score ( primary endpoint ; 18.07 vs. 18.49 ; p = 0.3873 ) and a slight worsening in the week 6 LS mean NPI ( 3.82 vs. 2.55 ; p = 0.0468 ) , primarily driven by decreased appetite/eating . RESULTS	Common treatment-related AEs were nausea ( 23.3 ; 3.4 % ) , vomiting ( 15.0 % ; 0 ) and decreased appetite ( 15.0 ; 6.8 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	Varenicline did not improve cognition , behavior or global change in this population . CONCLUSIONS	The most frequent varenicline-associated AEs were gastrointestinal ; psychiatric AEs were rare and similar between the groups ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare the effect of administration of probiotics on feeding tolerance and growth outcomes of HIV-exposed ( but uninfected ) versus HIV non-exposed preterm infants . OBJECTIVE	The null hypothesis of this study states that there will be no difference in the feeding tolerance and growth outcomes for both probiotic-exposed and unexposed premature very low birth weight infants . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted during the period from July 2011 to August 2012 . METHODS	HIV-exposed and non-exposed premature ( < 34 wk gestation ) infants with a birth weight of 500 g and 1250 g were randomized to receive either a probiotic mixture or placebo . METHODS	The multispecies probiotic mixture consisted of 1 10 ( 9 ) CFU , Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium infantis per day and was administered for 28 d. Anthropometrical parameters , daily intakes , and feeding tolerance were monitored . RESULTS	Seventy-four HIV-exposed and 110 unexposed infants were enrolled and randomized ( mean birth weight 987 g 160 g , range , 560-1244 g ; mean gestational age 28.7 wk ) . RESULTS	In all 4227 probiotic doses were administered ( mean 22.9 / infant ) . RESULTS	There was no difference in the average daily weight gain for treatment groups or HIV exposure . RESULTS	The HIV-exposed group achieved significantly higher z scores for length and head circumference at day 28 than the unexposed group ( P < 0.01 and P = 0.03 , respectively ) .

CONCLUSIONS	Probiotic supplementation did not affect growth outcomes or the incidence of any signs of feeding intolerance in HIV exposure ."
"OBJECTIVE	To observe the impacts of different frequencies of electroacupuncture ( EA ) on post-operative cognitive function and the change in serum S-100beta protein under the compound anesthesia of acupuncture and drugs . METHODS	One hundred and twenty-four patients of abdominal operation at selective time were randomized into a routine drug anesthesia group ( group A , 24 cases ) , a meridian point 2 Hz group ( group B , 26 cases ) , a me ridian point 2 Hz/100 Hz group ( group C , 25 cases ) , a meridian point 100 Hz group ( group D , 24 cases ) and a transcutaneous acupoint electric stimulation 2 Hz/100 Hz group ( group E , 25 cases ) . METHODS	In group A , the endotrachea-lgeneral anesthesia was applied . METHODS	In the rest groups , the acupuncture anesthesia was induced for 30 min before the endotracheal general anesthesia , at Baihui ( GV 20 ) , Yintang ( GV 29 ) and Neiguan ( PC 6 ) , with G6805-2 electric acupuncture apparatus used . METHODS	In group B , the continuous wave and 2Hz in frequency were selected . METHODS	In group C , the disperse-dense wave and 2 Hz/100 Hz in frequency were selected . METHODS	In group D , the continuous wave and 100 Hz in frequency were selected . METHODS	In group E , the disperse-dense wave and 2 Hz/100 Hz in frequency were selected , and the electrode pads were stick on the acupoints and connected with the electric stimulation till the end of operation . METHODS	Mini-mental state examination ( MMSE ) was adopted to evaluate and record the changes in cognitive function 1 day before operation and on the 3rd day after operation . METHODS	The conditions of post-operative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) in the patients and the changes in serum S-100beta protein were monitored before and at the end of operation . RESULTS	The incidence rate of POCD on the 3rd day after operation was 41.7 % ( 10/24 ) in group A. RESULTS	The incidence rates of POCD were 26.9 % ( 7/26 ) , 16.0 % ( 4/25 ) , 33.3 % ( 8/24 ) and 16.0 % ( 4/25 ) in group B , C , D and E separately . RESULTS	Compared with group A , the incidence rate of PCOD in group B , C , D and E were reduced ( all P < 0.05 ) , the incidence rate in group C and E were lower than that in groups B and D ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	At the end of operation , the level of serumS-100beta protein was ( 0.186 + / - 0.027 ) microg/L in group A , the levels were ( 0.165 + / - 0.028 ) microg/L , ( 0.166 + / - 0.027 ) microg/L , ( 0.163 + / - 0.025 ) microg/L and ( 0.164 + / - 0.025 ) microg/L in group B , C , D and E separately . RESULTS	The levels of serum S-100beta protein in group B , C , D and E were lower than that in group A separately ( all P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The general anesthesia assisted with EA at different frequencies reduces the incidence of cognitive dysfunctionand , decreases the level of serum S-100beta protein after intestinal cancer resection . CONCLUSIONS	The effects of the meridian point electric stimulation at 2 Hz/100 Hz and the transcutaneous electric stimulation at 2 Hz/100 Hz are the best . CONCLUSIONS	Hence , these two approaches of anesthesia deserve to be recommended practically ."
"OBJECTIVE	To test the efficacy of probiotic and prebiotic , alone or combined ( synbiotic ) , on the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) in very low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants . METHODS	A prospective , randomized , controlled trial was conducted at 5 neonatal intensive care units in Turkey . METHODS	VLBW infants ( n = 400 ) were assigned to a control group and 3 study groups that were given probiotic ( Bifidobacterium lactis ) , prebiotic ( inulin ) , or synbiotic ( Bifidobacterium lactis plus inulin ) added to breastmilk or formula for a maximum of 8 weeks before discharge or death . METHODS	The primary outcome was NEC ( Bell stage 2 ) . RESULTS	The rate of NEC was lower in probiotic ( 2.0 % ) and synbiotic ( 4.0 % ) groups compared with prebiotic ( 12.0 % ) and placebo ( 18.0 % ) groups ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	The times to reach full enteral feeding were faster ( P < .001 ) , the rates of clinical nosocomial sepsis were lower ( P = .004 ) , stays in the neonatal intensive care unit were shorter , ( P = .002 ) , and mortality rates were lower ( P = .003 ) for infants receiving probiotics , prebiotics , or synbiotic than controls . RESULTS	The use of antenatal steroid ( OR 0.5 , 95 % CI 0.3-0 .9 ) and postnatal probiotic ( alone or in synbiotic ) ( OR 0.5 , 95 % CI 0.2-0 .8 ) decreased the risk of NEC , and maternal antibiotic exposure increased this risk ( OR 1.9 , 95 % CI 1.1-3 .6 ) . CONCLUSIONS	In VLBW infants , probiotic ( Bifidobacterium lactis ) and synbiotic ( Bifidobacterium lactis plus inulin ) but not prebiotic ( inulin ) alone decrease NEC ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the long-term effect on symptoms and quality of life of esomeprazole 20mg once daily , a recommended dose for maintenance therapy of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . METHODS	This is a post hoc analysis of 5 year data from patients in the LOTUS trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT00251927 ) who were randomized to esomeprazole 20mg once daily . METHODS	All participants had chronic , symptomatic GERD responsive to treatment . METHODS	Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by physicians and by using patient-reported outcome instruments . METHODS	Investigations included gastrointestinal endoscopy ( with biopsy sampling ) , 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring and laboratory measurements . RESULTS	In total , 157 of 256 patients randomized to esomeprazole 20mg once daily remained on this dose until the end of follow-up or study discontinuation , whereas 99 patients had their dose increased because of inadequate symptom control ( of these , 29 subsequently returned to the allocated dose ) . RESULTS	On logistic regression , a long objectively defined GERD history , smoking , female sex , absence of Helicobacter pylori infection and high supine baseline acid reflux into the esophagus were associated with an increased likelihood of requiring dose escalation to esomeprazole 40mg daily ( all p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Symptoms were fairly stable and quality of life was normal throughout follow-up in patients remaining on esomeprazole 20mg once daily , with no more than mild symptom severity , and mean ( standard deviation ) percentage time with intraesophageal pH < 4 was reduced from 10.7 ( 10.7 ) pre-randomization to 6.3 ( 10.2 ) at 6 months and 4.9 ( 7.3 ) at 5 years . RESULTS	The number of serious adverse events was low ( 0.079 per patient per year ) . CONCLUSIONS	Post hoc analysis with no control group . CONCLUSIONS	Esomeprazole at a maintenance dose of 20mg once daily offers effective long-term treatment for chronic GERD in patients initially responsive to the medication , with durable symptom control and sustained reductions in intraesophageal acid exposure ."
"BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of rikkunshito ( RKT ) , a traditional Japanese medicine , combined with proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) in patients with PPI-refractory non-erosive reflux disease ( NERD ) . METHODS	Patients with PPI-refractory NERD ( n = 242 ) were randomly assigned to the RKT group [ rabeprazole ( 10 mg/day ) + RKT ( 7.5 g/t . METHODS	i.d. ) for 8 weeks ] or the placebo group ( rabeprazole + placebo ) . METHODS	After the 4 - and 8-week treatments , we assessed symptoms and quality of life ( QOL ) using the Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( FSSG ) , Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) , and Short-Form Health Survey-8 ( SF-8 ) . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in FSSG and GSRS score improvement between these groups after the 4 - and 8-week treatments . RESULTS	The mental component summary ( MCS ) scores of the SF-8 improved more in the RKT group ( from 45.8 8.1 to 48.5 7.4 ) than in the placebo group ( from 47.7 7.1 to 48.4 7.5 ) after the 4-week treatment ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The 8-week treatment with RKT was more effective for improvement of the degree of MCS score in patients with a low body mass index ( < 22 ) ( P < 0.05 ) and significantly improved the acid-related dysmotility symptoms of FSSG in female and elderly patients ( 65 years ) . CONCLUSIONS	There were no significant differences in improvement of GERD symptoms in patients with PPI-refractory NERD between these groups . CONCLUSIONS	However , RKT may be useful for improving mental QOL in non-obese patients and acid-related dyspeptic symptoms , especially in women and the elderly ."
"OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether probiotics had an effect on proinflammatory markers and cytokines in overweight and obese individuals and whether they could have synergistic effects with weight-loss diets . METHODS	A total of 75 healthy overweight and obese individuals completed this randomized doubled-blind controlled clinical trial . METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to groups consuming regular yogurt with a low-calorie diet ( LCD , RLCD ; n = 25 ) or receiving probiotic yogurt with LCD ( PLCD ; n = 25 ) or consuming probiotic yogurt without LCD ( PWLCD ; n = 25 ) for 8 weeks . METHODS	The pribiotic regimen contained 200 g/day yogurt , enriched by Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 , Bifidobacterium BB12 , and Lactobacillus casei DN001 10 ( 8 ) colony-forming units/g . METHODS	Body fat percentage , high-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF - ) , leptin , and mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes ( TNF - and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma [ ROR-t ] ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were measured . RESULTS	A reduction in body mass index ( BMI ) , fat percentage , and leptin level was observed that was more obvious in groups who received the weight-loss diet with probiotic yogurt . RESULTS	Reduction in the gene expression of ROR-t was significant in the PLCD group ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The expression of TNF - did not change among all groups after intervention . RESULTS	The mean concentration of leptin was significantly decreased in all groups after the dietary intervention , but the mean changes in leptin level in the PLCD group was more prominent compared to the other two groups ( -2.38 , p < 0.001 [ PLCD ] vs -1.75 , p = 0.002 [ RLCD ] and -0.55 ng/mL , p = 0.12 [ PWLCD ] ) . RESULTS	The reduction in serum levels of hs-CRP was more evident in the PWLCD group compared to the PLCD and RLCD groups after the 8-week intervention ( -3.4 , p = 0.03 vs -1.76 , p < 0.001 and -2.98 pg/mL , p < 0.001 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggested that the weight-loss diet and probiotic yogurt had synergistic effects on T-cells subset specific gene expression in PBMCs , fat percentage , and body weight among overweight and obese individuals ."
"BACKGROUND	Conventional methods of caries removal are commonly associated with pain , fear and discomfort . BACKGROUND	Chemomechanical methods were introduced to instill a positive dental attitude . BACKGROUND	Agents like GK-101 , Caridex , Carisolv did not prove effective alternatives owing to their high cost , need of special instruments and taste of chlorine . BACKGROUND	A new chemomechanical agent , Papacarie , has been introduced to overcome these deficiencies . OBJECTIVE	This study was aimed to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of Papacrie with the conventional method . METHODS	25 children with at least two primary teeth with broad cavitated occlusal or cervical lesion were selected . METHODS	One carious tooth from each patient was randomly treated with each of Papacarie and conventional drilling method , one after the other . METHODS	Time taken for caries excavation , child 's pain perception , change in anxiety levels , microbial flora and child 's preference of treatment were recorded separately for both the methods . RESULTS	Although the mean time taken for caries removal by the Papacarie method was slightly longer ( P0 .05 ) but it led to reduction in pain and anxiety ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The viable bacterial counts were significantly reduced by either of the two methods ( P < 00001 ) . RESULTS	More patients preferred Papacarie over conventional method of treatment ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Papacrie method seems to be a better alternative to conventional method of caries removal ."
"OBJECTIVE	Adverse events during colonoscopy are more likely to occur in elderly . OBJECTIVE	To avoid the adverse events without decreasing the bowel cleanliness is still an unsolved problem . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of enteral nutrition before colonoscopy in a randomized controlled trail . METHODS	A total of 108 patients over sixty-five years of age and indicated for colonoscopy were randomized into four groups . METHODS	Group 1 received a solution of two packages of polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder dissolved in 2000 mL water .

"BACKGROUND	Endoscopic variceal ligation ( EVL ) is effective in preventing esophageal variceal rebleeding . BACKGROUND	However , the optimal EVL interval remains unclear . OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effectiveness and safety of EVL using two intersession intervals . OBJECTIVE	methods : From January 2009 to October 2012 , 214 patients with acute esophageal variceal bleeding were screened . OBJECTIVE	Emergency ligation was performed for patients with acute variceal bleeding . OBJECTIVE	After achieving hemodynamic stability , eligible patients ( n = 70 ) were randomized to either the monthly group or the biweekly group . RESULTS	Median time from randomization to variceal obliteration was 2.7 months in the monthly group and 1.7 months in the biweekly group , at a mean of 2.3 2.0 and 3.0 1.8 sessions , respectively . RESULTS	After a median follow up of 23 months , six patients ( 17 % ) in the monthly group and nine patients ( 26 % ) in the biweekly group developed upper gastrointestinal rebleeding ( P = 0.382 ) . RESULTS	Esophageal variceal rebleeding occurred in six patients ( 17 % ) in the monthly group and in seven patients ( 20 % ) in the biweekly group ( P = 0.759 ) . RESULTS	No rebleeding from EVL ulcers occurred in the monthly group and was 5.7 % ( n = 2 ) for the biweekly group . RESULTS	Both treatment groups had similar rates of esophageal variceal recurrence and mortality . RESULTS	Notably , the incidence of post-EVL ulcers in the monthly group was lower than that in the biweekly group ( 11 % vs 57 % , P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Patients receiving EVL monthly had similar rebleeding rate , variceal recurrence , and mortality to those receiving EVL biweekly for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding ; however , the monthly interval was associated with fewer post-EVL ulcers found at follow-up endoscopies ."

"OBJECTIVE	Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma , a cancer with a rapidly increasing incidence in the western world . OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could decrease the rate of neoplastic progression . METHODS	Multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 136 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia at 9 European sites between June 2007 and June 2011 . METHODS	Patient follow-up ended May 2013 . METHODS	Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endoscopic treatment with radiofrequency ablation ( ablation ) or endoscopic surveillance ( control ) . METHODS	Ablation was performed with the balloon device for circumferential ablation of the esophagus or the focal device for targeted ablation , with a maximum of 5 sessions allowed . METHODS	The primary outcome was neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma during a 3-year follow-up since randomization . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and adverse events . RESULTS	Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive ablation and 68 to receive control . RESULTS	Ablation reduced the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma by 25.0 % ( 1.5 % for ablation vs 26.5 % for control ; 95 % CI , 14.1 % -35.9 % ; P < .001 ) and the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma by 7.4 % ( 1.5 % for ablation vs 8.8 % for control ; 95 % CI , 0 % -14.7 % ; P = .03 ) . RESULTS	Among patients in the ablation group , complete eradication occurred in 92.6 % for dysplasia and 88.2 % for intestinal metaplasia compared with 27.9 % for dysplasia and 0.0 % for intestinal metaplasia among patients in the control group ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19.1 % of patients receiving ablation ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	The most common adverse event was stricture , occurring in 8 patients receiving ablation ( 11.8 % ) , all resolved by endoscopic dilation ( median , 1 session ) . RESULTS	The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the trial due to superiority of ablation for the primary outcome and the potential for patient safety issues if the trial continued . CONCLUSIONS	In this randomized trial of patients with Barrett esophagus and a confirmed diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia , radiofrequency ablation resulted in a reduced risk of neoplastic progression over 3 years of follow-up .

"OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the impact of early enteral nutrition ( EEN ) on the clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients after radical gastrectomy . METHODS	Four hundred gastric cancer patients undergoing radical gastrectomy of any extend with D2 nodal dissection were randomly divided into an experimental and a control group with 200 cases in each group . METHODS	Patients in the control group received postoperative parenteral nutrition ( PN ) , while patients in the experimental group received postoperative EEN . METHODS	After treatment , the clinical outcomes , postoperative immune function , and nutritional status of the two groups were evaluated . RESULTS	The postoperative fever time , intestinal function recovery time , anal exhaust time , and the length of hospital stay for patients in the experimental group were significantly shorter than those of the control group . RESULTS	We did not find significant differences in anastomotic leak , postoperative ileus and regurgitation between the two groups . RESULTS	The activities of multiple immune cell types , including CD3 , CD4 , CD4/CD8 , and natural killer ( NK ) cells , were significantly lower in both groups on postoperative day 1 when compared with the preoperative levels ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The level of CD8 was not significantly different between the two groups ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	After treatment , levels of CD3 , CD4 , CD4/CD8 , and NK cells in the experimental group patients were 35.6 4.2 , 42.2 3.0 , 1.7 0.3 , and 27.3 5.3 % , respectively , on postoperative day 7 , which were similar to the preoperative levels . RESULTS	The immune cell levels from the control group patients remained significantly lower when compared with preoperative values ; in addition , these values were also significantly lower when compared with the EEN patients ( p < 0.05 ) CONCLUSION : For gastric cancer patients undergoing radical gastrectomy , the clinical outcome , immune function and nutritional status after EEN were significantly improved . RESULTS	These data suggest the widespread use of EEN in clinical practice ."
"BACKGROUND	This was a randomized , open-label , three-way crossover study to assess the effects of AST-120 ( an orally administered spherical carbon adsorbent acting in the gastrointestinal tract without systemic circulation ) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of metoprolol in an extended-release formulation ( metoprolol ER ) in healthy volunteers . METHODS	A total of 34 subjects were singly administered metoprolol ER alone ( A ) , and metoprolol ER in combination with AST-120 simultaneously ( B ) and 1 h later ( C ) . RESULTS	The total exposure was more significantly reduced in both treatments B and C than that in treatment A ; the geometric mean ratios of area under the curve extrapolated to infinity ( AUC0 - ) for B/A and C/A were reduced by approximately 30 % in both treatments B and C. Maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of metoprolol in treatment B significantly decreased , whereas Cmax in treatment C was slightly decreased . RESULTS	AST-120 treatment was unlikely to affect apparent first-order terminal elimination half-life ( T1/2 ) of metoprolol significantly . RESULTS	Reduction in heart rate and blood pressure readings were similar across the treatment periods . RESULTS	Coadministration of AST-120 and metoprolol ER was safe and was well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	Because AST-120 reduced gastrointestinal absorption of metoprolol ER , careful monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is recommended in coadministration of AST-120 with metoprolol ER ."
"OBJECTIVE	Celiac disease ( CeD ) is a prevalent autoimmune condition . OBJECTIVE	Recurrent signs and symptoms are common despite treatment with a gluten-free diet ( GFD ) , yet no approved or proven nondietary treatment is available . METHODS	In this multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , we assessed larazotide acetate 0.5 , 1 , or 2 mg 3 times daily to relieve ongoing symptoms in 342 adults with CeD who had been on a GFD for 12 months or longer and maintained their current GFD during the study . METHODS	The study included a 4-week placebo run-in , 12 weeks of treatment , and a 4-week placebo run-out phase . METHODS	The primary end point was the difference in average on-treatment Celiac Disease Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale score . RESULTS	The primary end point was met with the 0.5-mg dose of larazotide acetate , with fewer symptoms compared with placebo by modified intention to treat ( n = 340 ) ( analysis of covariance , P = .022 ; mixed model for repeated measures , P = .005 ) . RESULTS	The 0.5-mg dose showed an effect on exploratory end points including a 26 % decrease in celiac disease patient-reported outcome symptomatic days ( P = .017 ) , a 31 % increase in improved symptom days ( P = .034 ) , a 50 % or more reduction from baseline of the weekly average abdominal pain score for 6 or more of 12 weeks of treatment ( P = .022 ) , and a decrease in the nongastrointestinal symptoms of headache and tiredness ( P = .010 ) . RESULTS	The 1 - and 2-mg doses were no different than placebo for any end point . RESULTS	Safety was comparable with placebo . CONCLUSIONS	Larazotide acetate 0.5 mg reduced signs and symptoms in CeD patients on a GFD better than a GFD alone . CONCLUSIONS	Although results were mixed , this study was a successful trial of a novel therapeutic agent targeting tight junction regulation in patients with CeD who are symptomatic despite a GFD . CONCLUSIONS	Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01396213 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Many national colorectal cancer screening campaigns have a similar structure . OBJECTIVE	First , individuals are invited to take a noninvasive screening test , and , second , in the case of a positive screening test result , they are advised to undergo a more invasive follow-up test . OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate how much individuals ' participation decision in noninvasive screening is affected by the presence or absence of detailed information about invasive follow-up testing and how this effect varies over screening tests . METHODS	We used a labeled discrete choice experiment of three noninvasive colorectal cancer screening types with two versions that did or did not present respondents with detailed information about the possible invasive follow-up test ( i.e. , colonoscopy ) and its procedure . METHODS	We used data from 631 Dutch respondents aged 55 to 75 years . METHODS	Each respondent received only one of the two versions ( N = 310 for the invasive follow-up test information specification version , and N = 321 for the no-information specification version ) . RESULTS	Mixed logit model results show that detailed information about the invasive follow-up test negatively affects screening participation decisions . RESULTS	This effect can be explained mainly by a decrease in choice shares for the most preferred screening test ( a combined stool and blood sample test ) . RESULTS	Choice share simulations based on the discrete choice experiment indicated that presenting invasive follow-up test information decreases screening participation by 4.79 % . CONCLUSIONS	Detailed information about the invasive follow-up test has a negative effect on individuals ' screening participation decisions in noninvasive colorectal cancer screening campaigns . CONCLUSIONS	This result poses new challenges for policymakers who aim not only to increase uptake but also to provide full disclosure to potential screening participants ."

METHODS	They were eligible when they had suboptimum glycaemic control ( HbA1c 7.1-11 .0 % [ 54-97 mmol/mol ] ) despite maximum tolerated doses of metformin alone or with a sulfonylurea for at least 3 months , a stable bodyweight for at least 3 months , and a BMI of 25-45 kg/m ( 2 ) ( 23-45 kg/m ( 2 ) in South Korea and Taiwan ) . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) by computer-generated random sequence with an interactive voice-response system ( block size four , stratified by country and concomitant therapy ) to once-weekly exenatide ( 2 mg subcutaneous injection ) or once-daily glargine ( titrated to target ) to be given in addition to their existing oral glucose-lowering regimens . METHODS	The primary efficacy measure at 3 years was change in HbA1c from baseline in patients given at least one dose of the assigned drug ( ie , analyses by modified intention to treat ) . METHODS	Patients , investigators , and data analysts were not masked to treatment assignment . METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00641056 . RESULTS	456 patients underwent randomisation and received at least one dose of the assigned drug ( 233 given exenatide , 223 glargine ) . RESULTS	At 3 years , least-squares mean HbA1c change was -1.01 % ( SE 0.07 ) in the exenatide group versus -0.81 % ( 0.07 ) in the glargine group ( least-squares mean difference -0.20 % , SE 0.10 , 95 % CI -0.39 to -0.02 ; p = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	Transient gastrointestinal adverse events characteristic of GLP-1 receptor agonists were more frequent with exenatide than glargine ( nausea : 36 [ 15 % ] of 233 patients vs five [ 2 % ] of 223 ; vomiting : 15 [ 6 % ] vs six [ 3 % ] ; diarrhoea : 32 [ 14 % ] vs 15 [ 7 % ] ) , although frequency of these events did decrease after week 26 in the exenatide group . RESULTS	The proportion of patients who reported serious adverse events in the exenatide group ( 36 patients [ 15 % ] ) was the same as that in the glargine group ( 33 [ 15 % ] ) . RESULTS	The exposure-adjusted rate of overall hypoglycaemia was three times higher in patients given glargine ( 0.9 events per patient per year ) than in those given exenatide ( 0.3 events per patient per year ) . CONCLUSIONS	Efficacy of once-weekly exenatide is sustained for 3 years . CONCLUSIONS	GLP-1 receptor agonists could be a viable long-term injectable treatment option in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not yet started taking insulin .

"BACKGROUND	In 2007 , we began the randomised phase 3 multicentre HYPRO trial to investigate the effect of hypofractionated radiotherapy compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy on relapse-free survival in patients with prostate cancer . BACKGROUND	Here , we examine whether patients experience differences in acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse effects . METHODS	In this randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial , done in seven radiotherapy centres in the Netherlands , we enrolled intermediate-risk or high-risk patients aged between 44 and 85 years with histologically confirmed stage T1b-T4 NX-0MX-0 prostate cancer , a PSA concentration of 60 ng/mL or lower , and WHO performance status of 0-2 . METHODS	A web-based application was used to randomly assign ( 1:1 ) patients to receive either standard fractionation with 39 fractions of 2 Gy in 8 weeks ( five fractions per week ) or hypofractionation with 19 fractions of 34 Gy in 65 weeks ( three fractions per week ) . METHODS	Randomisation was done with minimisation procedure , stratified by treatment centre and risk group . METHODS	The primary endpoint is 5-year relapse-free survival . METHODS	Here we report data for the acute toxicity outcomes : the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity . METHODS	Non-inferiority of hypofractionation was tested separately for genitourinary and gastrointestinal acute toxic effects , with a null hypothesis that cumulative incidences of each type of adverse event were not more than 8 % higher in the hypofractionation group than in the standard fractionation group . METHODS	We scored acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxic effects according to RTOG-EORTC criteria from both case report forms and patients ' self-assessment questionnaires , at baseline , twice during radiotherapy , and 3 months after completion of radiotherapy . METHODS	Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population . METHODS	Patient recruitment has been completed . METHODS	This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com , number ISRCTN85138529 . RESULTS	Between March 19 , 2007 , and Dec 3 , 2010 , 820 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with standard fractionation ( n = 410 ) or hypofractionation ( n = 410 ) . RESULTS	3 months after radiotherapy , 73 ( 22 % ) patients in the standard fractionation group and 75 ( 23 % ) patients in the hypofractionation group reported grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicity ; grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity was noted in 43 ( 13 % ) patients in the standard fractionation group and in 42 ( 13 % ) in the hypofractionation group . RESULTS	Grade 4 acute genitourinary toxicity was reported for two patients , one ( < 1 % ) in each group . RESULTS	No grade 4 acute gastrointestinal toxicities were observed . RESULTS	We noted no significant difference in cumulative incidence by 120 days after radiotherapy of grade 2 or worse acute genitourinary toxicity ( 578 % [ 95 % CI 529-627 ] in the standard fractionation group vs 605 % ( 558-653 ) in the hypofractionation group ; difference 27 % , 90 % CI -299 to 848 ; odds ratio [ OR ] 112 , 95 % CI 084-149 ; p = 043 ) . RESULTS	The cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute gastrointestinal toxicity by 120 days after radiotherapy was higher in patients given hypofractionation ( 312 % [ 95 % CI 266-358 ] in the standard fractionation group vs 420 % [ 372-469 ] in the hypofractionation group ; difference 108 % , 90 % CI 525-1643 ; OR 16 ; p = 00015 ; non-inferiority not confirmed ) . CONCLUSIONS	Hypofractionated radiotherapy was not non-inferior to standard fractionated radiotherapy in terms of acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer . CONCLUSIONS	In fact , the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute gastrointestinal toxicity was significantly higher in patients given hypofractionation than in those given standard fractionated radiotherapy . CONCLUSIONS	Patients remain in follow-up for efficacy endpoints . BACKGROUND	The Dutch Cancer Society ."
"OBJECTIVE	Since probiotics modulate intestinal functions and enterohepatic circulation ; they might have an effect on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia treatment . OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Saccharomyces boulardii supplementation on hyperbilirubinemia . METHODS	A prospective , double-blind , placebo controlled trial was performed on 35 to 42 gestational weeks ' neonates . METHODS	They were randomized either to receive feeding supplementation with S. boulardii 125mg every 12 hours or placebo during phototherapy . METHODS	Serum bilirubin levels were measured at 0 , 24th , 48th , 72nd , and 96th hour of phototherapy . RESULTS	A total of 119 infants ( 61 in the control group and 58 in the study group ) were enrolled . RESULTS	The duration of phototherapy ( 2 [ 1-3 ] vs. 2 [ 1-3 ] , p : 0.22 ) was not different between groups . RESULTS	The levels of bilirubin during phototherapy ( [ 24th hour ; 14.1 { 12.8-15 .7 } vs. 13.5 { 12.4-14 .9 } , p : 0.085 ] ; [ 48th hour ; 14.1 { 12-15 .3 } vs. 13.4 { 12.4-14 .5 } , p : 0.41 ] ; [ 72nd hour ; 13.9 { 12.2-15 .6 } vs. 13.5 { 12.5-14 .5 } , p : 0.41 ] ; [ 96th hour ; 14.7 { 11.4-15 .5 } vs. 13.4 { 10.7-14 .1 } , p : 0.24 ] ) or the duration of rebound phototherapy ( 1 [ 1-1 ] vs. 1.5 [ 1-2 ] , p : 0.40 ) were lower in the study group than in the controls , but none of the values were statistically significant . CONCLUSIONS	S. boulardii did not influence the clinical course of hyperbilirubinemia significantly ."
"BACKGROUND	Haemodialysis patients suffer from accelerated vascular calcification . BACKGROUND	The vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein ( MGP ) is one of the most powerful inhibitors of vascular calcification . BACKGROUND	Haemodialysis patients have high levels of the inactive form of MGP ( desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated-MGP , dp-uc-MGP ) and may benefit from pharmacological doses of vitamin K2 ( menaquinone ) to improve the calcification inhibitory activity of MGP . METHODS	To determine the optimal dose of menaquinone-7 ( MK-7 ) for MGP activation , 200 chronic haemodialysis patients were recruited to randomly receive 360 , 720 or 1080 g of MK-7 thrice weekly for 8 weeks . METHODS	Dp-uc-MGP was measured at baseline and after 8 weeks . METHODS	Dietary intake of vitamin K1 ( phylloquinone ) and menaquinone was estimated based on a detailed questionnaire . RESULTS	At baseline , dp-uc-MGP was not associated with phylloquinone intake ( P = 0.92 ) , but correlated inversely with menaquinone intake ( P = 0.023 ) . RESULTS	MK-7 supplementation dose dependently reduced dp-uc-MGP . RESULTS	The levels decreased by 17 , 33 and 46 % in the respective groups . RESULTS	Drop-outs were mainly due to gastrointestinal side-effects related to the unpleasant smell of the tablets . CONCLUSIONS	Chronic haemodialysis patients have high levels of inactive MGP , possibly related to a low dietary vitamin K intake . CONCLUSIONS	Pharmacological doses of MK-7 dose-dependently reduce dp-uc-MGP . CONCLUSIONS	Menaquinone supplementation may be a novel approach to prevent vascular calcifications in chronic haemodialysis patients ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare safety and efficacy of pantoprazol , metoclopramide , ondansetron , as compared to placebo , in controlling gastrointestinal ( GI ) complaints of thyroid cancer patients treated with I-131these patients . METHODS	Four-armed , parallel group , single blind , randomized controlled clinical trial , setting : A university hospital , registration : database for clinical trials IRCT2013061713705N1 . METHODS	85 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who received 131I . METHODS	Postradioiodine nausea and vomiting within three days of therapy ( primary endpoint ) ; occurrence of adverse reaction . RESULTS	The patients ' characteristics were similar within the study groups . RESULTS	Among the study variables , age , sex , administered dosage , history of previous GI complaints , and history of hyperemesis gravidarum in female patients were not statistically different among the groups ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The results revealed that only ondansetron shows a therapeutic benefit over the placebo in controlling nausea ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , it does not prevent vomiting ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The other two drugs , pantoprazole and metoclopramide , did not control nausea ( p > 0.05 ) or vomiting ( p > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	This study may demonstrate that the therapeutic dose of ondansetron could be an effective prophylactic agent in controlling GI complaints in differential thyroid carcinoma ( DTC ) patients following RAI therapy ; however , these preliminary findings should be validated in larger studies ."
"BACKGROUND	Research directed to optimizing maternal nutrition commencing prior to conception remains very limited , despite suggestive evidence of its importance in addition to ensuring an optimal nutrition environment in the periconceptional period and throughout the first trimester of pregnancy . METHODS	This is an individually randomized controlled trial of the impact on birth length ( primary outcome ) of the time at which a maternal nutrition intervention is commenced : Arm 1 : 3 mo preconception vs. Arm 2 : 12-14 wk gestation vs. Arm 3 : none .192 ( derived from 480 ) randomized mothers and living offspring in each arm in each of four research sites ( Guatemala , India , Pakistan , Democratic Republic of the Congo ) . METHODS	The intervention is a daily 20 g lipid-based ( 118 kcal ) multi-micronutient ( MMN ) supplement . METHODS	Women randomized to receive this intervention with body mass index ( BMI ) < 20 or whose gestational weight gain is low will receive an additional 300 kcal/d as a balanced energy-protein supplement . METHODS	Researchers will visit homes biweekly to deliver intervention and monitor compliance , pregnancy status and morbidity ; ensure prenatal and delivery care ; and promote breast feeding . METHODS	The primary outcome is birth length . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include : fetal length at 12 and 34 wk ; incidence of low birth weight ( LBW ) ; neonatal/infant anthropometry 0-6 mo of age ; infectious disease morbidity ; maternal , fetal , newborn , and infant epigenetics ; maternal and infant nutritional status ; maternal and infant microbiome ; gut inflammatory biomarkers and bioactive and nutritive compounds in breast milk . METHODS	The primary analysis will compare birth Length-for-Age Z-score ( LAZ ) among trial arms ( independently for each site , estimated effect size : 0.35 ) . METHODS	Additional statistical analyses will examine the secondary outcomes and a pooled analysis of data from all sites . CONCLUSIONS	Positive results of this trial will support a paradigm shift in attention to nutrition of all females of child-bearing age . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01883193 ."
"OBJECTIVE	We studied the response to high doses of egg yolk containing antisecretory factor ( B221 , Salovum ) in young children with acute diarrhoea , presenting to the Children 's Hospital , Lahore , Pakistan . METHODS	In a randomised , placebo-controlled trial , 36 children aged 7 to 60 months with acute diarrhoea of unknown aetiology , with mild-to-moderate dehydration , were randomised to the Salovum or placebo groups . METHODS	Initially , 16 grams of Salovum or ordinary egg yolk ( placebo ) mixed in oral rehydration salts was given , followed by 8 g every 5 h until recovery . METHODS	The number and consistency of stools were recorded . RESULTS	The two groups were comparable in age , gender , duration of diarrhoea , hydration and nutritional status , although the proportion with watery stools was higher in the Salovum group ( p = 0.04 ) . RESULTS	Reduction in the frequency of stools was seen at 7 versus 18 h ( p < 0.0001 ) and normalising of stool consistency was 10 versus 18 h , p < 0.03 ) in the Salovum and placebo groups . RESULTS	The overall effect was 35 versus 70 h in the two groups ( p = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	No side effects were reported . CONCLUSIONS	High doses of AF in the form of Salovum effectively and safely reduce childhood diarrhoea of a likely broad aetiology ."
"BACKGROUND	Chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ; however , those patients often experience multiple treatment-related symptoms or symptom clusters . BACKGROUND	Two symptom clusters have been identified for this population . BACKGROUND	Little is known about the risk factors of these symptom clusters . METHODS	Subjects comprised 684 patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial . METHODS	This trial compared standard fractionation radiotherapy to accelerated fractionation radiotherapy . METHODS	Symptom clusters were evaluated at the end of the first and the second cycle of chemotherapy , and 3 months after the start of radiotherapy . METHODS	Mixed-effect modeling was used to observe risk factors for symptom clusters . RESULTS	Race and education were independent predictors for the head and neck cluster , whereas sex and history of tobacco use were independent predictors for the gastrointestinal cluster . RESULTS	Primary cancer site was only significant for the head and neck cluster when other factors were not controlled : patients with oropharyngeal cancer had more severe symptoms in the head and neck clusters than did patients with laryngeal cancer . RESULTS	In addition , patients receiving accelerated fractionation radiotherapy experienced more symptoms of radiomucositis , pain , and nausea at 3 months after the start of radiotherapy than those receiving standard fractionation radiotherapy . CONCLUSIONS	Demographic characteristics were more predictive to symptom clusters , whereas clinical characteristics , such as cancer site and treatment arms , were more significant for individual symptoms . CONCLUSIONS	Knowing the risk factors will enhance the capability of clinicians to evaluate patients ' risk of severe symptom clusters and to personalize management strategies ."
"OBJECTIVE	This prospective multicenter study examined whether elevated fecal calprotec tin ( FC ) concentrations after stopping TNF-blocking therapy can predict clinical or endoscopic relapse . OBJECTIVE	In addition , we evaluated the impact of histological remission on the relapse risk . METHODS	We enrolled inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patients who were in clinical , endoscopic , and FC-based ( < 100 g/g ) remission after a minimum 11 months of TNF-blocking therapy . METHODS	The patients were followed-up for 12 months after the discontinuation of TNF-blocking therapy . METHODS	FC was collected monthly for the first 6 months and thereafter every second month . METHODS	Ileocolonoscopy was performed at inclusion , at 4 months , at the study end , and at the time of clinical relapse . RESULTS	Of 52 enrolled patients , 49 ( 16 Crohn 's disease , 33 ulcerative colitis/IBD unclassified ) provided the stool samples requested and comprised the study group . RESULTS	During the follow-up , 15/49 ( 31 % ) relapsed , whereas 34 ( 69 % ) remained in remission . RESULTS	Patients relapsing showed constantly elevated FC levels for a median of 94 ( 13-317 ) days before the relapse . RESULTS	Significant increase in median FC levels was seen 2 ( p = 0.0014 ) , 4 ( p = 0.0056 ) , and 6 ( p = 0.0029 ) months before endoscopic relapse . RESULTS	Constantly normal FC concentrations during the follow-up were highly predictive for clinical and endoscopic remission . RESULTS	Normal FC concentrations in patients with remission were associated with histological remission . CONCLUSIONS	FC seems to increase and remain elevated before clinical or endoscopic relapse , suggesting that it can be used as a surrogate marker for predicting and identifying patients requiring close follow-up in clinical practice ."
"OBJECTIVE	Experimental pain models in human healthy volunteers are advantageous for early evaluation of analgesics . OBJECTIVE	All efforts to develop nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) which are devoid of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system effects are still far from achieving a breakthrough . OBJECTIVE	Hence we evaluated the analgesic activity of an ayurvedic drug , Boswellia serrata by using validated human pain models which has shown its analgesic activity both in-vitro and preclinical studies to evaluate the analgesic activity of single oral dose ( 125 mg , 2 capsules ) of Boswellia serrata compared to placebo using mechanical pain model in healthy human subjects . METHODS	After taking written informed consent , twelve healthy subjects were randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive single oral dose of Boswellia serrata ( Shallaki ( ) ) 125 mg , 2 capsules or identical placebo in a crossover design . METHODS	Mechanical pain was assessed using Ugo basile analgesymeter ( by Randall Selitto test ) at baseline and at 1 hr , 2 hrs and 3 hrs after test drug administration . METHODS	Pain Threshold force and time and Pain Tolerance force and time were evaluated . METHODS	Statistical analysis was done by paired t-test . RESULTS	Twelve healthy volunteers have completed the study . RESULTS	Mean percentage change from baseline in Pain Threshold force and time with Boswellia serrata when compared to placebo had significantly increased [ Force : 9.7 11.0 vs 2.9 3.4 ( P = 0.05 ) and time : 9.7 10.7 vs 2.8 3.4 ( P = 0.04 ) ] at third hr . RESULTS	Mean Percentage change from baseline in Pain Tolerance force and time with Boswellia serrata when compared to placebo had significantly ( P 0.01 ) increased at 1 hr , 2 hrs and 3 hrs . CONCLUSIONS	In the present study , Boswellia serrata significantly increased the Pain Threshold and Pain Tolerance force and time compared to placebo . CONCLUSIONS	Both study medications were well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	Further multiple dose studies may be needed to establish the analgesic efficacy of the drug ."
"OBJECTIVE	Repeated blood donation produces iron deficiency . OBJECTIVE	Changes in dietary iron intake do not prevent donation-induced iron deficiency . OBJECTIVE	Prolonging the interdonation interval or using oral iron supplements can mitigate donation-induced iron deficiency . OBJECTIVE	The most effective operational methods for reducing iron deficiency in donors are unknown . METHODS	` Strategies To Reduce Iron Deficiency ' ( STRIDE ) was a two-year , randomized , placebo-controlled study in blood donors . METHODS	692 donors were randomized into one of two educational groups or one of three interventional groups . METHODS	Donors randomized to educational groups either received letters thanking them for donating , or , suggesting iron supplements or delayed donation if they had low ferritin . METHODS	Donors randomized to interventional groups either received placebo , 19-mg or 38-mg iron pills . RESULTS	Iron deficient erythropoiesis was present in 527 % of males and 746 % of females at enrolment . RESULTS	Adverse events within 60 days of enrolment were primarily mild gastrointestinal symptoms ( 64 % ) . RESULTS	The incidence of de-enrolment within 60 days was more common in the interventional groups than in the educational groups ( P = 0002 ) , but not more common in those receiving iron than placebo ( P = 068 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The prevalence of iron deficient erythropoiesis in donors enrolled in the STRIDE study is comparable to previously described cohorts of regular blood donors . CONCLUSIONS	De-enrolment within 60 days was higher for donors receiving tablets , although no more common in donors receiving iron than placebo ."
"OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether screen-detected and apparently asymptomatic adults with endomysial antibodies ( EmA ) benefit from a gluten-free diet ( GFD ) . METHODS	We performed a prospective trial of 3031 individuals at risk for celiac disease based on screens for EmA . METHODS	Of 148 seropositive individuals , 40 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were assigned randomly to groups placed on a GFD or gluten-containing diets . METHODS	We evaluated ratios of small-bowel mucosal villous height : crypt depth , serology and laboratory test results , gastrointestinal symptom scores , physiologic well-being , perception of health by a visual analog scale , bone mineral density , and body composition at baseline and after 1 year . METHODS	Thereafter , the group on the gluten-containing diet started a GFD and was evaluated a third time ; subjects in the GFD group remained on this diet . RESULTS	After 1 year on the GFD , the mean mucosal villous height : crypt depth values increased ( P < .001 ) , levels of celiac-associated antibodies decreased ( P < .003 ) , and gastrointestinal symptoms improved to a greater extent than in patients on gluten-containing diets ( P = .003 ) . RESULTS	The GFD group also had reduced indigestion ( P = .006 ) , reflux ( P = .05 ) , and anxiety ( P = .025 ) , and better health , based on the visual analog scale ( P = .017 ) , than the gluten-containing diet group . RESULTS	Only social function scores improved more in the gluten-containing diet group than in the GFD group ( P = .031 ) . RESULTS	There were no differences between groups in laboratory test results , bone mineral density , or body composition . RESULTS	Most measured parameters improved when patients in the gluten-containing diet group were placed on GFDs . RESULTS	No subjects considered their experience to be negative and most expected to remain on GFDs . CONCLUSIONS	GFDs benefit asymptomatic EmA-positive patients . CONCLUSIONS	The results support active screening of patients at risk for celiac disease . CONCLUSIONS	Clinicaltrials.gov no : NCT01116505 ."
"BACKGROUND	Statin therapy reduces low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events , but whether the addition of ezetimibe , a nonstatin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption , can reduce the rate of cardiovascular events further is not known . METHODS	We conducted a double-blind , randomized trial involving 18,144 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg per deciliter ( 1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter ) if they were receiving lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter ( 1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter ) if they were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy . METHODS	The combination of simvastatin ( 40 mg ) and ezetimibe ( 10 mg ) ( simvastatin-ezetimibe ) was compared with simvastatin ( 40 mg ) and placebo ( simvastatin monotherapy ) . METHODS	The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , unstable angina requiring rehospitalization , coronary revascularization ( 30 days after randomization ) , or nonfatal stroke . METHODS	The median follow-up was 6 years . RESULTS	The median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter ( 1.4 mmol per liter ) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group , as compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter ( 1.8 mmol per liter ) in the simvastatin-monotherapy group ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary end point at 7 years was 32.7 % in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group , as compared with 34.7 % in the simvastatin-monotherapy group ( absolute risk difference , 2.0 percentage points ; hazard ratio , 0.936 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.89 to 0.99 ; P = 0.016 ) . RESULTS	Rates of prespecified muscle , gallbladder , and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	When added to statin therapy , ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes . CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , lowering LDL cholesterol to levels below previous targets provided additional benefit . CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by Merck ; IMPROVE-IT ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00202878 . )"
"OBJECTIVE	Caustic substance ingestion in childhood is a public health issue in developing countries , and several management protocols have been proposed to prevent the resulting esophageal strictures . OBJECTIVE	The role of corticosteroids in preventing corrosive-induced strictures is controversial . OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to study the influence of high doses of corticosteroids in preventing esophageal strictures . METHODS	Eighty-three children with a mean age of 4.10 6 2.63 years and with grade IIb esophageal burns ( an esophagogastroscopy was performed within 2448 hours of injury ) due to corrosive substance ingestion were enrolled in our study between 2005 and 2008 . METHODS	Forty-two children ( study group ) received methylprednisolone ( 1 g/1 .73 m2 per day for 3 days ) , ranitidine , ceftriaxone , and total parenteral nutrition . METHODS	Forty-one children ( control group ) were administered the same regimen excluding methylprednisolone . METHODS	Stricture development was compared between groups based on endoscopic and radiologic findings . RESULTS	During the endoscopic examination , stricture development was observed in 4 patients ( 10.8 % ) in the study group and in 12 patients ( 30 % ) in the control group . RESULTS	The difference was statistically significant ( P = .038 ) . RESULTS	The stricture development rate in the upper gastrointestinal system with barium meal was 14.3 % and 45.0 % in the study and control groups , respectively . RESULTS	The difference was statistically significant ( P = .004 ) . RESULTS	The duration of total parenteral nutrition was shorter in the study group compared with the control group ( P = .001 ) . RESULTS	High doses of methylprednisolone were well tolerated in the study group without any side effects . CONCLUSIONS	High doses of methylprednisolone used for the management of grade IIb esophageal burns may reduce stricture development ."
"BACKGROUND	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) may cause gastrointestinal damage in dogs . OBJECTIVE	To determine the extent to which lansoprazole , liquorice extract , and a herbal solution exhibit protective effects on colonic mucosa when administered to dogs concurrently with the NSAIDs carprofen or robenacoxib . METHODS	Thirty-five healthy beagle dogs ( 15 male and 20 female ) aged 13-14 weeks and weighing 4.3-5 .5 kg at the beginning of the experiment were included . METHODS	Endoscopy and biopsy of the caudal gastrointestinal tract were performed pretreatment and on the last day of a 21-day treatment period with ( 1 ) oral carprofen ; ( 2 ) carprofen and the proton-pump inhibitor lansoprazole ; ( 3 ) carprofen , liquorice extract , and a herbal solution that contained extracts of thyme , icelandic lichen , hyssop , and saponariae root ; ( 4 ) robenacoxib ; ( 5 ) robenacoxib and lansoprazole ; ( 6 ) robenacoxib , liquorice extract , and herbal solution ; or ( 7 ) an empty gelatin capsule . METHODS	Statistical analyses were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis , Cochran 's Q , and chi-squared test with p < 0.05 considered significant . RESULTS	Both carprofen and robenacoxib tested damaged the colonic mucosa with most severe microscopic lesions following administration of robenacoxib with lansoprazole . RESULTS	The risk of histopathological lesions in the colon increased most rapidly in robenacoxib with lansoprazole ( absolute risk increase -0.85 ) similar to robenacoxib only ( -0.75 ) , whereas the best result was recorded following the plant remedies together with carprofen ( -0.15 ) and the plant remedies together with robenacoxib ( -0.2 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Concurrent administration of liquorice extract and an herbal solution with robenacoxib was associated with decreased severity of the NSAID-induced mucosal lesions ."
"BACKGROUND	In our published randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 3-period crossover trial , healthy adult men ( n = 21 ) consumed bars containing no supplemental fiber ( placebo ; NFC ) , polydextrose ( 21 g/d ) , and soluble corn fiber ( SCF ; 21 g/d ) for 21 d each . BACKGROUND	Fecal specimens were collected between days 16 and 21 for fermentative end-product analysis and 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene amplification for bacterial taxa identification . BACKGROUND	Fiber supplementation decreased fecal putrefaction compounds and shifted abundances of several bacterial taxa . OBJECTIVE	The objective was to perform whole-genome shotgun 454 pyrosequencing on the same fecal specimens collected in that clinical trial to obtain comprehensive fecal bacterial genome sequencing coverage and explore the full range of bacterial genetic information in the fecal microbiome , thereby using a systematic approach to study the impact of dietary fiber supplementation on fecal metabolites , bacterial taxa , and bacterial metagenomes . METHODS	Fecal samples were subjected to whole-genome shotgun 454 pyrosequencing to identify both fecal bacterial populations present and their functional genetic capacity . RESULTS	Whole-genome shotgun sequencing results revealed that fiber consumption shifted the Bacteroidetes : Firmicutes ratio , increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes 12 2 % and 13 2 % with polydextrose and SCF , respectively , compared with NFC . RESULTS	Bivariate correlations showed a positive correlation between the Bacteroidetes : Firmicutes ratio and total dietary fiber intake but not body mass index . RESULTS	Principal coordinates analysis of Bray-Curtis distances indicated that bacterial gene composition was more similar in participants consuming fibers ( polydextrose and SCF combined ) in comparison with NFC . RESULTS	Shifts in bacterial gene abundances after polydextrose and SCF supplementation included genes associated with carbohydrate , amino acid , and lipid metabolism , as well as metabolism of cofactors and vitamins . CONCLUSIONS	This study conveys novel information about the impact of dietary fiber supplementation on the phylogenetic structure and functional capacity of the fecal microbiome of healthy adults ."

METHODS	The subjects consumed six different mixtures of dextrose , maltitol and scFOS added in a chocolate dairy dessert at a dosage of 35g . METHODS	The test days were separated by 2-week washout periods . METHODS	The subjects reported the intensity of four individual gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms , number of bowel movements and stool frequency for the 48h following consumption of the dessert . METHODS	A subgroup of 18 subjects also provided blood samples 2h after intake to evaluate the postprandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses . RESULTS	The composite score calculated from the intensity of flatulence , borborygmi , bloating and discomfort was significantly higher ( P < 0.0001 ) for all the desserts containing maltitol and/or scFOS than for the control dessert containing dextrose , but remains at the level of mild effects . RESULTS	The number of bowel movements was also slightly increased ( P = 0.0006 ) and the stools were softer ( P = 0.0045 ) for the first 24h but not after ( P = 0.1373 and 0.5420 , respectively ) . RESULTS	Blood glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were lower for all the sugar-free recipes containing maltitol and scFOS in comparison to the control one ( P < 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	This study has shown that maltitol and scFOS can be used jointly when formulating sugar-free foods with the benefit to lower postprandial glycaemic response with only a small and transient increase in non-serious GI symptoms ."
"BACKGROUND	Endemic malaria and helminth infections in sub-Saharan Africa can act as immunological modulators and impact responses to standard immunizations . BACKGROUND	We conducted a cohort study to measure the influence of malaria and helminth infections on the immunogenicity of the bivalent HPV-16 / 18 vaccine . METHODS	We evaluated the association between malaria and helminth infections , and HPV-16 / 18 antibody responses among 298 Tanzanian females aged 10-25 years enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of the HPV-16 / 18 vaccine . METHODS	Malaria parasitaemia was diagnosed by examination of blood smears , and helminth infections were diagnosed by examination of urine and stool samples , respectively . METHODS	Geometric mean antibody titres ( GMT ) against HPV-16 / 18 antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . RESULTS	Parasitic infections were common ; one-third ( 30.4 % ) of participants had a helminth infection and 10.2 % had malaria parasitaemia . RESULTS	Overall , the vaccine induced high HPV-16 / 18 GMTs , and there was no evidence of a reduction in HPV-16 or HPV-18 GMT at Month 7 or Month 12 follow-up visits among participants with helminths or malaria . RESULTS	There was some evidence that participants with malaria had increased GMTs compared to those without malaria . CONCLUSIONS	The data show high HPV immunogenicity regardless of the presence of malaria and helminth infections . CONCLUSIONS	The mechanism and significance for the increase in GMT in those with malaria is unknown ."
"OBJECTIVE	To observe the effects of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation ( TAES ) combined with general anesthesia ( acupuncture analgesia combined with general anesthesia ) on postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting and exhausted defecation symptoms in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic operation . METHODS	Sixty patients with gynecological laparoscopic operation were randomly divided into TAES group and control group , with 30 cases in each group . METHODS	Patients of the control group received simple general anesthesia and those of the TAES group were treated with general anesthesia and TAES of bilateral Zusanli ( ST 36 ) and Liangqiu ( ST 34 ) . METHODS	Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) was used for measuring the patients ' pain reaction at 8 h , 24 h and 72 h after surgery . METHODS	Symptoms of patients ' nausea and vomiting , post-operation exhaust and defecation time were recorded after operation . RESULTS	The VAS scores at time-points of 8 h , 24 h and 72 h and nausea level in the TAES group were significantly lower than those of the control group ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The vomiting severity of the TAES group was also relatively lower in comparison with the control group , but without significant difference between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The post-operation exhaust and defecation time of patients in the TAES group apparently appeared earlier than those of patients in the control group ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	TAES combined with general anesthesia is effective in reducing post-operative pain and nausea , and improving gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing laparoscopic operation ."

"BACKGROUND	Intestinal immunity induced by oral poliovirus vaccine ( OPV ) is imperfect and wanes with time , permitting transmission of infection by immunised children . BACKGROUND	Inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) does not induce an intestinal mucosal immune response , but could boost protection in children who are mucosally primed through previous exposure to OPV . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the effect of IPV on intestinal immunity in children previously vaccinated with OPV . METHODS	We did an open-label , randomised controlled trial in children aged 1-4 years from Chinnallapuram , Vellore , India , who were healthy , had not received IPV before , and had had their last dose of OPV at least 6 months before enrolment . METHODS	Children were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to receive 05 mL IPV intramuscularly ( containing 40 , 8 , and 32 D antigen units for serotypes 1 , 2 , and 3 ) or no vaccine . METHODS	The randomisation sequence was computer generated with a blocked randomisation procedure with block sizes of ten by an independent statistician . METHODS	The laboratory staff did blinded assessments . METHODS	The primary outcome was the proportion of children shedding poliovirus 7 days after a challenge dose of serotype 1 and 3 bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) . METHODS	A second dose of bOPV was given to children in the no vaccine group to assess intestinal immunity resulting from the first dose . METHODS	A per-protocol analysis was planned for all children who provided a stool sample at 7 days after bOPV challenge . METHODS	This trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry of India , number CTRI/2012/09 / 003005 . RESULTS	Between Aug 19 , 2013 , and Sept 13 , 2013 , 450 children were enrolled and randomly assigned into study groups . RESULTS	225 children received IPV and 225 no vaccine . RESULTS	222 children in the no vaccine group and 224 children in the IPV group had stool samples available for primary analysis 7 days after bOPV challenge . RESULTS	In the IPV group , 27 ( 12 % ) children shed serotype 1 poliovirus and 17 ( 8 % ) shed serotype 3 poliovirus compared with 43 ( 19 % ) and 57 ( 26 % ) in the no vaccine group ( risk ratio 062 , 95 % CI 040-097 , p = 00375 ; 030 , 018-049 , p < 00001 ) . RESULTS	No adverse events were related to the study interventions . CONCLUSIONS	The substantial boost in intestinal immunity conferred by a supplementary dose of IPV given to children younger than 5 years who had previously received OPV shows a potential role for this vaccine in immunisation activities to accelerate eradication and prevent outbreaks of poliomyelitis .

"BACKGROUND	This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effects of the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii on proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients with diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D ) . BACKGROUND	The other objectives were to document any clinical improvement as judged by symptoms , quality of life , and histology . METHODS	This was a randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled trial in which S. boulardii , 750 mg/day , or placebo was administered for 6 weeks in IBS-D patients , in addition to ispaghula husk standard treatment . RESULTS	Thirty-seven patients received S. boulardii and 35 patients received the placebo . RESULTS	As compared with placebo , the S. boulardii group showed a significant decrease in blood and tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) and tumor necrosis factor - ( P < 0.001 ) and an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels , as well as an increase in the tissue IL-10 / IL-12 ratio ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	No significant change in the blood and tissue levels of cytokines was found in the placebo group . RESULTS	Bowel-related IBS-D symptoms reported in the patients ' daily diary improved in both groups . RESULTS	However , overall improvement in the quality of life was more marked in the S. boulardii group . RESULTS	Although baseline histological findings were mild , an improvement was observed in the probiotic group in the lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltrates ( P = 0.017 and 0.018 ) , epithelial mitosis ( P = 0.003 ) , and intraepithelial lymphocytes ( P = 0.024 ) . RESULTS	No serious adverse events were found in either group . CONCLUSIONS	S. boulardii with ispaghula husk was superior to placebo with ispaghula husk in improving the cytokine profile , histology , and quality of life of patients with IBS-D . CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary results need to be confirmed in a well-powered trial ."
"OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to explore the effects of hypotonic and isotonic oral mannitol on intestinal distention and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( ( 18 ) F-FDG ) intake in PET/computed tomography ( CT ) imaging . METHODS	A total of 124 patients without gastrointestinal disease were evaluated with PET/CT imaging and divided into four groups using a random number table . METHODS	Group 1 drank plain water , group 2 drank 2.5 % mannitol , group 3 drank 2.5 % mannitol and also received 10mg of scopolamine butylbromide , and group 4 drank 2.5 % mannitol and also received 20mg of scopolamine butylbromide . METHODS	The patients in each group underwent PET/CT imaging 50min after ( 18 ) F-FDG injection . METHODS	In these groups , differences such as age , sex , disease distribution , oral liquid amount , and adverse reactions were compared . METHODS	Gastrointestinal distention and F-FDG intake were analyzed by two experts in nuclear medicine by visual observation . METHODS	Data were statistically analyzed using a rank-sum test , RC contingency table , one-way analysis of variance , and a paired t-test . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in blood glucose levels after oral administration of 2.5 % mannitol ( t = 0.62 , P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal distention of patients in groups 2 , 3 , and 4 was superior to that of patients in group 1 ( P < 0.05 / 6 ) . RESULTS	In addition to the sigmoid colon and rectum , ( 18 ) F-FDG intake in each part of the gastrointestinal tract in groups 2 , 3 , and 4 was less than that in group 1 ( P < 0.05 / 6 ) . RESULTS	Patients in group 4 experienced significantly more adverse reactions compared with patients in the other groups ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Oral negative contrast agent and hypotonic bowel preparation decreased the physiological intake of ( 18 ) F-FDG , increased the distention of the gastrointestinal tract , and thus improved the image quality ."
"OBJECTIVE	Overnight lens wear is associated with increased lens contamination and risk of developing a corneal infiltrate or infectious event . OBJECTIVE	Antibacterial lenses have been proposed as a potential strategy for reducing lens contamination . OBJECTIVE	A proof-of-principle study was conducted to investigate what effect control of potential pathogens , through the use of antibiotic eye drops , would have on the incidence of corneal infiltrative events ( CIEs ) and on the ocular microbiota and lens contamination . METHODS	This is a prospective , open-label , controlled , parallel-group , 1-month clinical study in which 241 subjects were dispensed with lotrafilcon A silicone hydrogel lenses for 30 days of continuous wear . METHODS	Subjects were randomized into either test ( moxifloxacin 0.5 % ) or control ( rewetting solution ) group . METHODS	One drop was instilled into each eye on waking and before sleeping , while lenses were on-eye . METHODS	Follow-ups were conducted after one night and 1 month . METHODS	Lid margin swabs were taken at baseline and at 1 month and worn lenses were aseptically collected at 1 month . RESULTS	The incidence of CIEs was not significantly different between the test ( 2.6 % ) and control ( 3.9 % ) groups ( p = 0.72 ) . RESULTS	Microorganism levels from the test group swabs were significantly lower than those from the control group ( p = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Gram-positive bacteria were less frequently recovered from lower lid swabs from the test group ( 39.6 % vs. 66.0 % [ p < 0.001 ] , test vs. control , respectively ) or from contact lens samples ( 1.9 % vs. 10.5 % [ p = 0.015 ] , test vs. control , respectively ) , but there was no difference in gram-negative bacteria ( GNB ) . RESULTS	Corneal infiltrative events were associated with higher levels of lens contamination ( p = 0.014 ) and contamination of lenses with GNB ( CIE : 7.3 % vs. 0.6 % [ p = 0.029 ] , GNB contamination vs. no GNB contamination , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	Twice-daily antibiotic instillation during continuous wear of lenses did not significantly influence the rate of inflammatory events . CONCLUSIONS	Corneal infiltrative events were associated with higher levels of lens contamination in general and with contamination by GNB specifically ."
"BACKGROUND	Dulaglutide and liraglutide , both glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) receptor agonists , improve glycaemic control and reduce weight in patients with type 2 diabetes . BACKGROUND	In a head-to-head trial , we compared the safety and efficacy of once-weekly dulaglutide with that of once-daily liraglutide in metformin-treated patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes . METHODS	We did a phase 3 , randomised , open-label , parallel-group study at 62 sites in nine countries between June 20 , 2012 , and Nov 25 , 2013 . METHODS	Patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes receiving metformin ( 1500 mg/day ) , aged 18 years or older , with glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 70 % or greater ( 53 mmol/mol ) and 100 % or lower ( 86 mmol/mol ) , and body-mass index 45 kg/m ( 2 ) or lower were randomly assigned to receive once-weekly dulaglutide ( 15 mg ) or once-daily liraglutide ( 18 mg ) . METHODS	Randomisation was done according to a computer-generated random sequence with an interactive voice response system . METHODS	Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation . METHODS	The primary outcome was non-inferiority ( margin 04 % ) of dulaglutide compared with liraglutide for change in HbA1c ( least-squares mean change from baseline ) at 26 weeks . METHODS	Safety data were collected for a further 4 weeks ' follow-up . METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat . METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01624259 . RESULTS	We randomly assigned 599 patients to receive once-weekly dulaglutide ( 299 patients ) or once-daily liraglutide ( 300 patients ) . RESULTS	269 participants in each group completed treatment at week 26 . RESULTS	Least-squares mean reduction in HbA1c was -142 % ( SE 005 ) in the dulaglutide group and -136 % ( 005 ) in the liraglutide group . RESULTS	Mean treatment difference in HbA1c was -006 % ( 95 % CI -019 to 007 , pnon-inferiority < 00001 ) between the two groups . RESULTS	The most common gastrointestinal adverse events were nausea ( 61 [ 20 % ] in dulaglutide group vs 54 [ 18 % ] in liraglutide group ) , diarrhoea ( 36 [ 12 % ] vs 36 [ 12 % ] ) , dyspepsia ( 24 [ 8 % ] vs 18 [ 6 % ] ) , and vomiting ( 21 [ 7 % ] vs 25 [ 8 % ] ) , with similar rates of study or study drug discontinuation because of adverse events between the two groups ( 18 [ 6 % ] in each group ) . RESULTS	The hypoglycaemia rate was 034 ( SE 144 ) and 052 ( 301 ) events per patient per year , respectively , and no severe hypoglycaemia was reported . CONCLUSIONS	Once-weekly dulaglutide is non-inferior to once-daily liraglutide for least-squares mean reduction in HbA1c , with a similar safety and tolerability profile .

"OBJECTIVE	Studies reporting that budesonide is effective for the treatment of collagenous colitis have been small and differed in efficacy measures . OBJECTIVE	Mesalamine has been proposed as a treatment option for collagenous colitis , although its efficacy has never been investigated in placebo-controlled trials . OBJECTIVE	We performed a phase 3 , placebo-controlled , multicenter study to evaluate budesonide and mesalamine as short-term treatments for collagenous colitis . METHODS	Patients with active collagenous colitis were randomly assigned to groups given pH-modified release oral budesonide capsules ( 9 mg budesonide once daily , Budenofalk , n = 30 ) , mesalamine granules ( 3 g mesalamine once daily , Salofalk , n = 25 ) , or placebo for 8 weeks ( n = 37 ) in a double-blind , double-dummy fashion . METHODS	The study was conducted in 31 centers ( hospital clinics and private practices ) in Germany , Denmark , Lithuania , Spain , and the United Kingdom . METHODS	The primary end point was clinical remission at 8 weeks defined as 3 stools per day . METHODS	Secondary end points included clinical remission at 8 weeks , according to the Hjortswang-Criteria of disease activity , taking stool consistency into account . RESULTS	A greater percentage of patients in the budesonide group were in clinical remission at week 8 than the placebo group ( intention-to-treat analysis , 80.0 % vs 59.5 % ; P = .072 ; per-protocol analysis , 84.8 % vs 60.6 % ; P = .046 ) . RESULTS	Based on the Hjortswang-Criteria , 80.0 % of patients given budesonide achieved clinical remission compared with 37.8 % of patients given placebo ( P = .0006 ) ; 44.0 % of patients given mesalamine achieved clinical remission , but budesonide was superior to mesalamine ( P = .0035 ) . RESULTS	Budesonide significantly improved stool consistency and mucosal histology , and alleviated abdominal pain . RESULTS	The rate of adverse events did not differ among groups . CONCLUSIONS	Oral budesonide ( 9 mg once daily ) is effective and safe for short-term treatment of collagenous colitis . CONCLUSIONS	Short-term treatment with oral mesalamine ( 3 g once daily ) appears to be ineffective . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00450086 ."
"BACKGROUND	The incidence and prognostic impact of late bleeding complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) are unknown . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to identify the incidence , predictors , and prognostic impact of major late bleeding complications ( MLBCs ) ( 30 days ) after TAVR . METHODS	Clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of patients who underwent TAVR within the randomized cohorts and continued access registries in the PARTNER ( Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves ) trial were analyzed after stratifying by the occurrence of MLBCs . METHODS	Predictors of MLBCs and their association with 30-day to 1-year mortality were assessed . RESULTS	Among 2,401 patients who underwent TAVR and survived to 30 days , MLBCs occurred in 142 ( 5.9 % ) at a median time of 132 days ( interquartile range : 71 to 230 days ) after the index procedure . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal complications ( n = 58 [ 40.8 % ] ) , neurological complications ( n = 22 [ 15.5 % ] ) , and traumatic falls ( n = 11 [ 7.8 % ] ) were identified as the most frequent types of MLBCs . RESULTS	Independent predictors of MLBCs were the presence of low hemoglobin at baseline , atrial fibrillation or flutter at baseline or 30 days , the presence of moderate or severe paravalvular leak at 30 days , and greater left ventricular mass at 30 days . RESULTS	MLBCs were identified as a strong independent predictor of mortality between 30 days and 1 year ( adjusted hazard ratio : 3.91 ; 95 % confidence interval : 2.67 to 5.71 ; p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	MLBCs after TAVR were frequent and associated with increased mortality . CONCLUSIONS	Better individualized and risk-adjusted antithrombotic therapy after TAVR is urgently needed in this high-risk population . CONCLUSIONS	( THE PARTNER TRIAL : Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valve Trial ; NCT00530894 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) is a major cause of travellers ' diarrhoea . BACKGROUND	We investigated the efficacy and safety of a skin-patch vaccine containing the pathogen 's heat-labile toxin ( LT ) in a population of travellers to Mexico and Guatemala . METHODS	In this phase 3 , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled field trial , healthy adults ( aged 18-64 years ) travelling from Germany or the UK to Mexico or Guatemala were assigned in a 1:1 ratio by a dynamic electronic randomisation system to receive transcutaneous immunisation with a patch containing 37.5 g of ETEC LT or a placebo patch . METHODS	Participants , site staff , and the investigators who did the analyses were masked to group assignment . METHODS	Participants were vaccinated before travel , with two patches given 14 days apart . METHODS	In the destination country , participants tracked stool output in a diary and provided stool samples for pathogen identification if diarrhoea occurred . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with at least one episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea ( defined as four or more unformed stools in a 24 h period ) in which either or both ETEC enterotoxins ( LT and heat-stable toxin [ ST ] ) were detected . METHODS	The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00993681 . RESULTS	2036 participants were recruited and randomly assigned between Oct 14 , 2009 , and Aug 13 , 2010 , with 1016 allocated to receive the LT patch and 1020 the placebo patch . RESULTS	821 participants in the LT-patch group and 823 in the placebo group received both vaccinations and were analysed in the per-protocol population . RESULTS	30 ( 3.7 % , 95 % CI 2.5-5 .2 ) participants in the LT-patch group and 46 ( 5.6 % , 4.1-7 .4 ) in the placebo group had moderate or severe ETEC diarrhoea ( vaccine efficacy 34.6 % , -2.2 to 58.9 ; p = 0.0621 ) . RESULTS	9333 local ( ie , patch-site ) adverse events ( including erythema , rash , pruritus , hyperpigmentation , pain , hypopigmentation , and oedema ) occurred in 943 ( 93 % ) of 1015 participants in the LT-patch group , compared with 1444 local adverse events in 574 ( 56 % ) of 1019 participants in the placebo group ( p < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Serious adverse events occurred in 25 participants ( 14 in the LT-patch group and 11 in the placebo group ) , with all regarded as either unrelated or possibly related to treatment . RESULTS	Vaccine-induced hyperpigmentation persisted for at least 180 days after vaccination in 150 ( 18 % ) of the 849 participants who received both vaccinations and returned for final assessment in the LT-patch group , compared with none of the 842 participants in the placebo group . RESULTS	The vaccine was immunogenic , with a post-vaccination geometric mean titre of LT-specific serum immunoglobulin G of 3400.29 , compared with 315.41 in the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	Although the LT antigen was delivered effectively by the skin patch , the vaccine did not protect travellers against diarrhoea caused by ETEC or other organisms . CONCLUSIONS	Future vaccines against travellers ' diarrhoea might need to include several antigens against various diarrhoeal pathogens , and might need to be able to generate mucosal and higher systemic immunity ."
"OBJECTIVE	Preclinical investigations support the use of probiotics in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia , but clinical evidence is often contrasting . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic formulation containing three Bifidobacterium strains on lipid profiles in children affected by primary dyslipidemia . METHODS	Thirty-eight children with dyslipidemia , ages 10.8 2.1 y , were enrolled in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study . METHODS	After a 4-wk diet run-in period , the children received probiotics ( B. animalis subspecies lactis MB 2409 , B. bifidum MB 109B , and B. longum subspecies longum BL04 ) or placebo for 3 mo. . METHODS	After 1 mo , wash-out treatments were switched . METHODS	Astrict dietary evaluation concerning satured fatty acids and cholesterol content , STEP I diet accordingly , was performed by a dietitian who examined the weekly dietary diary at each visit . RESULTS	Baseline lipid profile was ( mean SD ) : total cholesterol ( TC ) 222.8 23.2 mg/dL , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) 55.8 12.2 mg/dL , triglycerides ( TG ) 99.0 61.7 mg/dL , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) 147.2 21.9 mg/dL . RESULTS	After 3 mo of probiotic treatment , the lipid profile was : TC 211.9 27.3 mg/dL , HDL-C 60.7 14.2 mg/dL , TG 79.5 34.5 mg/dL , and LDL-C 135.3 24.2 mg/dL . RESULTS	Compared with placebo , probiotics reduced TC by 3.4 % ( P = 0.02 ) and LDL-C by 3.8 % ( P = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	No significant dietary change occurred through the study and no relevant adverse effects were observed . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with a Bifidobacterium probiotic formulation was well tolerated and useful in combination with to diet therapy . CONCLUSIONS	Children with dyslipidemia benefited from this approach , although the results need to be confirmed by larger controlled studies ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal toxicity in dogs receiving chemotherapy with vincristine and cyclophosphamide and the efficacy of maropitant citrate ( Cerenia , Zoetis ) in reducing these events . METHODS	Dogs receiving chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide or vincristine were randomised to either receive maropitant or not in the period immediately after treatment and for 4 days afterwards . METHODS	Owners completed a diary of adverse events following treatment . RESULTS	Adverse events occurred in 40/58 ( 69 % ) dogs in the vincristine group . RESULTS	Most of these adverse events were mild and included : lethargy ( 62 % ) , appetite loss ( 43 % ) , diarrhoea ( 34 % ) and vomiting ( 24 % ) . RESULTS	Adverse events occurred in 34/42 ( 81 % ) dogs treated with cyclophosphamide . RESULTS	Most of these adverse events were mild and included : lethargy ( 62 % ) , diarrhoea ( 36 % ) , appetite loss ( 36 % ) and vomiting ( 21 % ) . RESULTS	There was no difference in total clinical score , vomiting , diarrhoea , appetite loss or lethargy score between dogs treated with maropitant and non-treated dogs in either the vincristine or cyclophosphamide groups . CONCLUSIONS	Chemotherapy-related side effects are frequent but usually mild in dogs receiving vincristine or cyclophosphamide . CONCLUSIONS	Prophylactic administration of maropitant does not reduce the frequency of adverse events and maropitant should be administered only as required for individual cases ."
"BACKGROUND	Breastfeeding elicits significant protection against respiratory tract infections in infancy . BACKGROUND	Modulation of respiratory microbiota might be part of the natural mechanisms of protection against respiratory diseases induced by breastfeeding . OBJECTIVE	To study the association between breastfeeding and nasopharyngeal microbial communities , including all cultivable and noncultivable bacteria . METHODS	In this observational study , we analyzed the microbiota of infants that had received exclusive breastfeeding ( n = 101 ) and exclusive formula feeding ( n = 101 ) at age 6 weeks and 6 months by 16S-based GS-FLX-titanium-pyrosequencing . RESULTS	At 6 weeks of age the overall bacterial community composition was significantly different between breastfed and formula-fed children ( nonmetric multidimensional scaling , P = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Breastfed children showed increased presence and abundance of the lactic acid bacterium Dolosigranulum ( relative effect size [ RES ] , 2.61 ; P = 0.005 ) and Corynebacterium ( RES , 1.98 ; P = 0.039 ) and decreased abundance of Staphylococcus ( RES , 0.48 ; P 0.03 ) and anaerobic bacteria , such as Prevotella ( RES , 0.25 ; P < 0.001 ) and Veillonella ( RES , 0.33 ; P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Predominance ( > 50 % of the microbial profile ) of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum was observed in 45 ( 44.6 % ) breastfed infants compared with 19 ( 18.8 % ) formula-fed infants ( relative risk , 2.37 ; P = 0.006 ) . RESULTS	Dolosigranulum abundance was inversely associated with consecutive symptoms of wheezing and number of mild respiratory tract infections experienced . RESULTS	At 6 months of age associations between breastfeeding and nasopharyngeal microbiota composition had disappeared . CONCLUSIONS	Our data suggest a strong association between breastfeeding and microbial community composition in the upper respiratory tract of 6-week-old infants . CONCLUSIONS	Observed differences in microbial community profile may contribute to the protective effect of breastfeeding on respiratory infections and wheezing in early infancy . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT 00189020 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Concurrent treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by maintenance temozolomide is the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma . BACKGROUND	Bevacizumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A , is currently approved for recurrent glioblastoma . BACKGROUND	Whether the addition of bevacizumab would improve survival among patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is not known . METHODS	In this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , we treated adults who had centrally confirmed glioblastoma with radiotherapy ( 60 Gy ) and daily temozolomide . METHODS	Treatment with bevacizumab or placebo began during week 4 of radiotherapy and was continued for up to 12 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy . METHODS	At disease progression , the assigned treatment was revealed , and bevacizumab therapy could be initiated or continued . METHODS	The trial was designed to detect a 25 % reduction in the risk of death and a 30 % reduction in the risk of progression or death , the two coprimary end points , with the addition of bevacizumab . RESULTS	A total of 978 patients were registered , and 637 underwent randomization . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the duration of overall survival between the bevacizumab group and the placebo group ( median , 15.7 and 16.1 months , respectively ; hazard ratio for death in the bevacizumab group , 1.13 ) . RESULTS	Progression-free survival was longer in the bevacizumab group ( 10.7 months vs. 7.3 months ; hazard ratio for progression or death , 0.79 ) . RESULTS	There were modest increases in rates of hypertension , thromboembolic events , intestinal perforation , and neutropenia in the bevacizumab group . RESULTS	Over time , an increased symptom burden , a worse quality of life , and a decline in neurocognitive function were more frequent in the bevacizumab group . CONCLUSIONS	First-line use of bevacizumab did not improve overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma . CONCLUSIONS	Progression-free survival was prolonged but did not reach the prespecified improvement target .

"OBJECTIVE	Measurement of central blood pressure provides prognostic information beyond conventional peripheral blood pressure ( BP ) . OBJECTIVE	However , few studies have directly compared the effects of antihypertensives on central hemodynamics . OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the effects of a low-dose combination of nifedipine Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System ( GITS ) and valsartan versus high-dose monotherapy with either agent in reducing central BP in essential hypertension inadequately controlled by low-dose monotherapy . METHODS	In this prospective , open-label , randomized , active-controlled , multicenter 8-week study , patients not meeting the target BP after 4 weeks of treatment with low-dose monotherapy were randomized to receive nifedipine GITS 30mg plus valsartan 80mg ( N30 + V80 ) , nifedipine GITS 60mg ( N60 ) , or valsartan 160mg ( V160 ) for a further 4 weeks . METHODS	Central hemodynamics were measured by applanation tonometry . RESULTS	A total of 391 patients were enrolled . RESULTS	Reduction in central systolic BP from baseline to week 8 , the primary efficacy variable , was significantly greater in the N30 + V80 group ( -27.214.7 mmHg ) and the N60 group ( -27.116.5 mmHg ) compared with V160 group ( -14.416.6 mmHg ) . RESULTS	Decrease in the augmentation index in the N60 group was significantly greater compared with V160 alone , without differences between combination therapy and either high-dose monotherapy . RESULTS	Decreases in brachial systolic BP were significantly greater in the N30 + V80 and N60 groups than in the V160 group . RESULTS	By multiple regression analysis , most differences in drug effects on central hemodynamics disappeared after controlling for changes in peripheral BP . RESULTS	A low rate of adverse events occurred in all treatment groups . CONCLUSIONS	A low-dose combination of nifedipine GITS plus valsartan or high-dose nifedipine was more effective in improving central hemodynamics than high-dose valsartan in patients with hypertension , mostly because of the improvement in peripheral ( brachial ) hemodynamics ."
"OBJECTIVE	Inhibition of brain aminopeptidase A ( APA ) , which converts angiotensin II into angiotensin III , has emerged as a novel antihypertensive treatment , as demonstrated in several experimental animal models . OBJECTIVE	QGC001 ( originally named RB150 ) is a prodrug of the specific and selective APA inhibitor EC33 , and as such it is the prototype of a new class of centrally acting antihypertensive agents . OBJECTIVE	Given by the oral route in hypertensive rats , it enters the brain and generates EC33 , which blocks the brain renin-angiotensin system activity and normalises blood pressure . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety , pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of QGC001 in humans . METHODS	Fifty-six healthy male volunteers were randomly assigned to receive in double-blind and fasted conditions single oral doses of 10 , 50 , 125 , 250 , 500 , 750 , 1,000 and 1,250 mg of QGC001 ( n = 6/dose ) or placebo ( n = 2/dose ) . METHODS	We measured plasma and urine concentrations of both QGC001 and EC33 by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry , plasma renin concentrations ( PRC ) , plasma and free urine aldosterone ( PAldo and UAldo ) , plasma copeptine ( PCop ) , and plasma and urine cortisol ( PCort and UCort ) concentrations , and supine systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) at various time points . RESULTS	All doses of QGC001 were clinically and biologically well-tolerated . RESULTS	Peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) of QGC001 and EC33 increased linearly with the dose , with a median time to reach Cmax ( tmax ) of 1.5 h for QGC001 and 3.0 h for EC33 . RESULTS	The median plasma elimination half-life of QGC001 was 1.6 h consistently throughout doses . RESULTS	Urinary excretion of QGC001 and EC33 was below 2 % of the administered dose . RESULTS	When compared with placebo , QGC001 did not significantly change PRC , PAldo , UAldo , PCop , PCort or UCort . RESULTS	No significant change was observed for supine HR , SBP and DBP in any treatment group . CONCLUSIONS	Single oral administration of QGC001 up to 1,250 mg in healthy volunteers was well-tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	Following oral administration , QGC001 is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and converted partially into its active metabolite EC33 in plasma . CONCLUSIONS	As in animal experiments , in normotensive subjects QGC001 had no effect on the systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone parameters and on PCop concentrations , a marker of vasopressin release . CONCLUSIONS	In normotensive subjects , a single dose of QCG001 had no effect on SBP , DBP or HR . CONCLUSIONS	These data support further evaluation of multiple oral doses of QGC001 in human volunteers and its clinical efficacy in hypertensive patients ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate effects of quaternary benzo ( c ) phenanthridine alkaloids ( QBAs ) against Salmonella spp and determine effects on growth performance , organism shedding , and gastrointestinal tract integrity in pigs inoculated with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . METHODS	36 Salmonella isolates and twenty 5-week-old pigs . METHODS	Minimum inhibitory concentration of QBAs against the Salmonella isolates was determined . METHODS	Pigs were allocated to 4 groups and inoculated with Salmonella organisms . METHODS	Pigs received diets supplemented with 1.5 g of QBAs/1 ,000 kg of feed , 0.75 g of QBAs/1 ,000 kg of feed , or 59.4 g of chlortetracycline/1 ,000 kg of feed or a nonsupplemented ( control ) diet . METHODS	Pigs were weighed on day 0 and then weekly for 40 days . METHODS	Fecal samples were collected to quantify Salmonella organisms . METHODS	Gastrointestinal tract integrity was evaluated by measuring transepithelial resistance . RESULTS	In vitro , 9 of 36 ( 25 % ) Salmonella isolates were inhibited at 90 g of QBAs/mL ; all 36 were inhibited at 179 g of QBAs/mL . RESULTS	Diets containing QBAs significantly decreased Salmonella spp shedding ; shedding was lower 40 days after inoculation for pigs fed diets containing QBAs or chlortetracycline than for pigs fed the control diet . RESULTS	Growth performance was similar for pigs fed diets containing QBA or chlortetracycline . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal tract integrity was improved in pigs fed the diet containing 1.5 g of QBAs/1 ,000 kg of feed . CONCLUSIONS	QBAs and chlortetracycline decreased Salmonella spp shedding but did not differ with regard to growth performance . CONCLUSIONS	Gastrointestinal tract integrity was better , albeit not significantly , in pigs fed diets containing QBAs . CONCLUSIONS	Further investigation into the role of QBAs and their mechanism as an immunomodulator is necessary ."
"BACKGROUND	New antibiotics are needed to treat infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria . BACKGROUND	Tedizolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial drug designed to provide enhanced activity against Gram-positive pathogens . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous to oral tedizolid for treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections . METHODS	ESTABLISH-2 was a randomised , double-blind , phase 3 , non-inferiority trial done between Sept 28 , 2011 , and Jan 10 , 2013 , at 58 centres in nine countries . METHODS	Patients ( aged 12 years ) with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections ( cellulitis or erysipelas , major cutaneous abscess , or wound infection ) that had a minimum lesion area of 75 cm ( 2 ) and were suspected or documented to be associated with a Gram-positive pathogen , were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) , via an interactive voice-response system with block randomisation , to receive intravenous once-daily tedizolid ( 200 mg for 6 days ) or twice-daily linezolid ( 600 mg for 10 days ) , with optional oral step-down . METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and type of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection . METHODS	The primary endpoint was early clinical response ( 20 % reduction in lesion area at 48-72 h compared with baseline ) , with a non-inferiority margin of -10 % . METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat . METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01421511 . RESULTS	666 patients were randomly assigned to receive tedizolid ( n = 332 ) or linezolid ( n = 334 ) . RESULTS	283 ( 85 % ) patients in the tedizolid group and 276 ( 83 % ) in the linezolid group achieved early clinical response ( difference 26 % , 95 % CI -30 to 82 ) , meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal adverse events were less frequent with tedizolid than linezolid , taking place in 52 ( 16 % ) of 331 patients and 67 ( 20 % ) of 327 patients in the safety population . RESULTS	Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported by one ( < 1 % ) patient in the tedizolid group and four ( 1 % ) patients in the linezolid group . CONCLUSIONS	Intravenous to oral once-daily tedizolid 200 mg for 6 days was non-inferior to twice-daily linezolid 600 mg for 10 days for treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections . CONCLUSIONS	Tedizolid could become a useful option for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections in the hospital and outpatient settings .

"OBJECTIVE	We assessed whether wheat bran extract ( WBE ) containing arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides ( AXOS ) elicited a prebiotic effect and modulated gastrointestinal ( GI ) parameters in healthy preadolescent children upon consumption in a beverage . METHODS	This double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial evaluated the effects of consuming WBE at 0 ( control ) or 5.0 g/day for 3 weeks in 29 healthy children ( 8-12 years ) . METHODS	Fecal levels of microbiota , short-chain fatty acids , branched-chain fatty acids , ammonia , moisture , and fecal pH were assessed at the end of each treatment and at the end of a 1-week run-in ( RI ) period . METHODS	In addition , the subjects completed questionnaires scoring distress severity of 3 surveyed GI symptoms . METHODS	Finally , subjects recorded defecation frequency and stool consistency . RESULTS	Nominal fecal bifidobacteria levels tended to increase after 5 g/day WBE consumption ( P = 0.069 ) , whereas bifidobacteria expressed as percentage of total fecal microbiota was significantly higher upon 5 g/day WBE intake ( P = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	Additionally , 5 g/day WBE intake induced a significant decrease in fecal content of isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid ( P < 0.01 ) , markers of protein fermentation . RESULTS	WBE intake did not cause a change in distress severity of the 3 surveyed GI symptoms ( flatulence , abdominal pain/cramps , and urge to vomit ) ( P > 0.1 ) . CONCLUSIONS	WBE is well tolerated at doses up to 5 g/day in healthy preadolescent children . CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the intake of 5 g/day exerts beneficial effects on gut parameters , in particular an increase in fecal bifidobacteria levels relative to total fecal microbiota , and reduction of colonic protein fermentation ."
"OBJECTIVE	Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) is a potential treatment for constipation refractory to standard therapies . OBJECTIVE	However , there have been no randomized controlled studies examining its efficacy . OBJECTIVE	In patients with slow transit constipation , we evaluated the efficacy of suprasensory and subsensory SNS compared with sham , in a prospective , 18-week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two-phase crossover study . OBJECTIVE	The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who , on more than 2 days/week for at least 2 of 3 weeks , reported a bowel movement associated with a feeling of complete evacuation . METHODS	After 3 weeks of temporary peripheral nerve evaluation ( PNE ) , all patients had permanent implantation and were randomized to subsensory/sham ( 3 weeks each ) and then re-randomized to suprasensory/sham ( 3 weeks each ) with a 2-week washout period between each arm . METHODS	Daily stool dairies were kept , and quality of life ( QoL ; SF36 ) was measured at the end of each arm . RESULTS	Between November 2006 and March 2012 , 234 constipated patients were assessed , of whom 59 were willing and deemed eligible to participate ( 4 male ; median age 42 years ) . RESULTS	Of the 59 patients , 16 ( 28 % ) responded to PNE . RESULTS	Fifty-five patients went on to permanent SNS implantation . RESULTS	The proportion of patients satisfying the primary outcome measure did not differ between suprasensory ( 30 % ) and sham ( 21 % ) stimulations , nor between subsensory ( 25 % ) and sham ( 25 % ) stimulations .

"BACKGROUND	Whether noninvasive ventilation should be administered in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is debated . BACKGROUND	Therapy with high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula may offer an alternative in patients with hypoxemia . METHODS	We performed a multicenter , open-label trial in which we randomly assigned patients without hypercapnia who had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less to high-flow oxygen therapy , standard oxygen therapy delivered through a face mask , or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation . METHODS	The primary outcome was the proportion of patients intubated at day 28 ; secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality in the intensive care unit and at 90 days and the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 . RESULTS	A total of 310 patients were included in the analyses . RESULTS	The intubation rate ( primary outcome ) was 38 % ( 40 of 106 patients ) in the high-flow-oxygen group , 47 % ( 44 of 94 ) in the standard group , and 50 % ( 55 of 110 ) in the noninvasive-ventilation group ( P = 0.18 for all comparisons ) . RESULTS	The number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was significantly higher in the high-flow-oxygen group ( 248 days , vs. 2210 in the standard-oxygen group and 1912 in the noninvasive-ventilation group ; P = 0.02 for all comparisons ) . RESULTS	The hazard ratio for death at 90 days was 2.01 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.01 to 3.99 ) with standard oxygen versus high-flow oxygen ( P = 0.046 ) and 2.50 ( 95 % CI , 1.31 to 4.78 ) with noninvasive ventilation versus high-flow oxygen ( P = 0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS	In patients with nonhypercapnic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure , treatment with high-flow oxygen , standard oxygen , or noninvasive ventilation did not result in significantly different intubation rates . CONCLUSIONS	There was a significant difference in favor of high-flow oxygen in 90-day mortality .

"BACKGROUND	Evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis ( AD ) through induction of immunosuppression and immune tolerance ; however , the exact underlying mechanism is unclear . BACKGROUND	Few studies to date have examined the effects of probiotics on adult-type AD . OBJECTIVE	To examine the effects of the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis LKM512 on adult-type AD and the expression of metabolites that are known to be influenced by gut microbiota in fecal samples . METHODS	Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive LKM512 or a placebo and underwent medical examinations . METHODS	Fecal microbiota were analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction . METHODS	Metabolomic analysis was conducted to search for antipruritic metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria using feces derived from 3 patients whose itch scores had improved using capillary electrophoresis with time-of-flight mass spectrometry . METHODS	Antipruritic effects of kynurenic acid were observed using AD-induced NC/Nga mice . RESULTS	LKM512 administration alleviated itch in AD patients compared with controls and improved the dermatology-specific quality-of-life scores when compared with the controls . RESULTS	Administration of LKM512 also increased the expression of the antipruritic and antinociceptive metabolite kynurenic acid ( KYNA ) in patients whose itch score had improved after LKM512 treatment . RESULTS	In mouse experiments , scratching behavior counts tended to be decreased by KYNA injection when compared with no treatment . CONCLUSIONS	LKM512 administration may exert antipruritic effects by increasing KYNA production . CONCLUSIONS	LKM512 could therefore be a potentially effective therapeutic candidate for the reduction of pruritus . BACKGROUND	umin.ac.jp / ctr Identifier : UMIN000005695 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy ( IG-IMRT ) allows significant dose reductions to organs at risk in prostate cancer patients . OBJECTIVE	However , clinical data identifying the benefits of IG-IMRT in daily practice are scarce . OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to compare dose distributions to organs at risk and acute gastrointestinal ( GI ) and genitourinary ( GU ) toxicity levels of patients treated to 78 Gy with either IG-IMRT or 3D-CRT . METHODS	Patients treated with 3D-CRT ( n = 215 ) and IG-IMRT ( n = 260 ) receiving 78 Gy in 39 fractions within 2 randomized trials were selected . METHODS	Dose surface histograms of anorectum , anal canal , and bladder were calculated . METHODS	Identical toxicity questionnaires were distributed at baseline , prior to fraction 20 and 30 and at 90 days after treatment . METHODS	Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) grade 1 , 2 , and 3 endpoints were derived directly from questionnaires . METHODS	Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were applied . RESULTS	The median volumes receiving 5 to 75 Gy were significantly lower ( all P < .001 ) with IG-IMRT for anorectum , anal canal , and bladder . RESULTS	The mean dose to the anorectum was 34.4 Gy versus 47.3 Gy ( P < .001 ) , 23.6 Gy versus 44.6 Gy for the anal canal ( P < .001 ) , and 33.1 Gy versus 43.2 Gy for the bladder ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	Significantly lower grade 2 toxicity was observed for proctitis , stool frequency 6/day , and urinary frequency 12/day . RESULTS	IG-IMRT resulted in significantly lower overall RTOG grade 2 GI toxicity ( 29 % vs 49 % , respectively , P = .002 ) and overall GU grade 2 toxicity ( 38 % vs 48 % , respectively , P = .009 ) . CONCLUSIONS	A clinically meaningful reduction in dose to organs at risk and acute toxicity levels was observed in IG-IMRT patients , as a result of improved technique and tighter margins . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore reduced late toxicity levels can be expected as well ; additional research is needed to quantify such reductions ."
"BACKGROUND	In two of three phase 3 trials , pirfenidone , an oral antifibrotic therapy , reduced disease progression , as measured by the decline in forced vital capacity ( FVC ) or vital capacity , in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ; in the third trial , this end point was not achieved . BACKGROUND	We sought to confirm the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on disease progression in such patients . METHODS	In this phase 3 study , we randomly assigned 555 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to receive either oral pirfenidone ( 2403 mg per day ) or placebo for 52 weeks . METHODS	The primary end point was the change in FVC or death at week 52 . METHODS	Secondary end points were the 6-minute walk distance , progression-free survival , dyspnea , and death from any cause or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . RESULTS	In the pirfenidone group , as compared with the placebo group , there was a relative reduction of 47.9 % in the proportion of patients who had an absolute decline of 10 percentage points or more in the percentage of the predicted FVC or who died ; there was also a relative increase of 132.5 % in the proportion of patients with no decline in FVC ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Pirfenidone reduced the decline in the 6-minute walk distance ( P = 0.04 ) and improved progression-free survival ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	There was no significant between-group difference in dyspnea scores ( P = 0.16 ) or in rates of death from any cause ( P = 0.10 ) or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( P = 0.23 ) . RESULTS	However , in a prespecified pooled analysis incorporating results from two previous phase 3 trials , the between-group difference favoring pirfenidone was significant for death from any cause ( P = 0.01 ) and from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( P = 0.006 ) . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events were more common in the pirfenidone group than in the placebo group but rarely led to treatment discontinuation . CONCLUSIONS	Pirfenidone , as compared with placebo , reduced disease progression , as reflected by lung function , exercise tolerance , and progression-free survival , in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment was associated with an acceptable side-effect profile and fewer deaths . CONCLUSIONS	( Funded by InterMune ; ASCEND ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01366209 . )"
"BACKGROUND	Acute pancreatitis is a severe condition that requires early identification of patients at risk of developing potentially lethal complications . BACKGROUND	Current clinical scoring systems and biochemical parameters are insufficient . BACKGROUND	In this study , we aimed to assess whether early plasma Angiopoietin-2 ( Ang-2 ) is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) . METHODS	This analysis is a substudy of the PROPATRIA trial ( probiotics vs placebo in patients with predicted SAP ) . METHODS	The Ang-2 levels were measured prospectively in plasma in the first 5 days after admission in 115 patients . RESULTS	Early Ang-2 levels were higher in patients who developed SAP : 6.4 vs 3.1 g/L ( p < 0.001 ) and also were higher in patients who developed multiorgan failure in the first week ( p = 0.001 ) and after the first week ( p = 0.049 ) . RESULTS	Furthermore , high Ang-2 levels were associated with infectious complications in the first week ( p < 0.001 ) and after the first week ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Finally , plasma Ang-2 was significantly higher in patients who died ( p < 0.001 ) and in patients who developed bowel ischemia ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	As a predictor of adverse outcomes , plasma Ang-2 was superior to a number of current scores , such as the APACHE II score , the Imrie score , C-reactive protein , lipopolysaccharide binding protein , and procalcitonin . CONCLUSIONS	In the setting of this randomized controlled trial , early plasma Ang-2 was found to be an accurate predictor of SAP , multiorgan failure , and infectious complications . CONCLUSIONS	As a biomarker , it did outperform all of the investigated conventional predictors that are currently used in clinical practice ."

"OBJECTIVE	To compare the therapeutic effect of probiotics and oral immunoglobulin on pediatric rotavirus enteritis . METHODS	A randomized , controlled trial was conducted in 150 children with rotavirus enteritis who were randomly divided into control , probiotic and immunoglobulin groups ( n = 50 each ) . METHODS	In addition to basic treatment , the control group was given placebo , the probiotic group was given live combined bifidobacterium and lactobacillus tablets , and the immunoglobulin group was orally given anti-rotavirus egg yolk immunoglobulin ( IgY ) . METHODS	Clinical symptoms such as stool frequency and stool properties were recorded every day . METHODS	Fresh stool samples were collected on days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 of treatment . METHODS	Intestinal flora imbalance was detected and divided into three degrees by microscopic examination of stool . METHODS	Fecal SIgA level and fecal rotavirus shedding were measured by radioimmunoassay and double-antibody sandwich ELISA respectively . RESULTS	Compared with the control group , the probiotic group had reduced intestinal flora imbalance , decreased stool frequency , and reduced incidence of secondary intestinal bacterial infection after 3 days of treatment ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in disease course between the probiotic and control groups . RESULTS	Compared with the control group , the immunoglobulin group had a significantly increased fecal SIgA level after 1 day of treatment ( P < 0.05 ) , significantly decreased frequency of diarrhea and fecal rotavirus shedding after 3 days of treatment ( P < 0.05 ) , and a significantly shorter disease course ( 4.51.0 vs 5.81.7 days ; P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	For children with rotavirus enteritis , probiotics can reduce intestinal flora imbalance and prevent secondary intestinal bacterial infection , but probiotics take a long time to relieve clinical symptoms and can not shorten the course of disease . CONCLUSIONS	Oral immunoglobulin takes effect quickly and can rapidly eliminate rotavirus , promote the production of SIgA , and shorten the course of disease ."
"OBJECTIVE	Organ motion is a contributory factor to the variation in location of the prostate and organs at risk during a course of fractionated prostate radiation therapy ( RT ) . OBJECTIVE	A prospective randomized controlled trial was designed with the primary endpoint to provide evidence-based bladder-filling instructions to achieve a consistent bladder volume ( BV ) and thus reduce the bladder-related organ motion . OBJECTIVE	The secondary endpoints were to assess the incidence of acute and late genitourinary ( GU ) and gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity for patients and patients ' satisfaction with the bladder-filling instructions . METHODS	One hundred ten patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 bladder-filling protocols ; 540 mL ( 3 cups ) of water or 1080 mL ( 6 cups ) of water , in a single institution trial . METHODS	A portable ultrasound device , BladderScan BVI 6400 ( Verathon Inc , Bothell , WA ) , measured BVs at treatment planning computed tomography ( TPCT ) scan and 3 times per week during RT. . METHODS	Maximum bladder dose and BV receiving 50 , 60 , and 70 Gy were recorded . METHODS	Acute and late GU and GI toxicity were evaluated , as were patients ' comfort , perception of urinary symptoms , and quality of life ( QoL ) . RESULTS	There was significantly less BV variation in the 540 mL arm when compared with 1080 mL ( median : 76 mL vs 105 mL , P = .003 ) . RESULTS	Larger BVs on initial TPCT correlated with larger BV variations during RT ( P < .0005 ) . RESULTS	There were no statistically significant associations between arm and GU/GI toxicity , dose median comfort scores , or median QoL scores . CONCLUSIONS	The 540 mL bladder-filling arm resulted in reproducible BVs throughout a course of RT , without any deterioration in QoL or increase in toxicities for prostate patients ."
"BACKGROUND	Because of the increasing resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole , new therapeutic alternatives are needed . BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of 7 - and 10-day triple therapy including omeprazole , levofloxacin and amoxicilline for Helicobacter pylori eradication as a first-line therapy . METHODS	One hundred and five patients with peptic ulcer disease and with non-ulcer dyspepsia infected with Helicobacter pylori were included in this study . METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive either 7-day or 10-day therapy with omeprazole ( 20 mg b.i.d. ) , plus levofloxacin ( 500 mg o.i.d. ) and amoxicilline ( 1000 mg b.i.d. ) . METHODS	Eradication was assessed by negative histological analyses , negative H. pylori stool antigen or rapid urease test . RESULTS	In Group 1 , the eradication rate was 86 , 2 % , while in group 2 , eradication rate was 93,6 % . RESULTS	There was no difference between groups ( p = 0.218 ) . RESULTS	Adverse effects were reported in 5 , 25 % of the patients , including nausea and diarrhea . CONCLUSIONS	The levofloxacin-based regimen can be one effective therapy for the first-line anti-H . CONCLUSIONS	pylori treatment . CONCLUSIONS	However , a levofloxacin-based triple therapy is not generally recommended as first-line therapy at the moment due to concerns about the rising prevalence of quinolone-resistant strains in the first-line and second-line anti-H . CONCLUSIONS	pylori therapies ."
"BACKGROUND	Patients with heartburn but without esophageal erosion respond less well to proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) . BACKGROUND	There is a growing body of evidence implicating the role of psychological comorbidities in producing reflux symptoms . BACKGROUND	Pain modulators improve symptoms in patients with other functional gastrointestinal disorders . BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare the efficacy of fluoxetine with omeprazole and placebo to achieve symptomatic relief in patients with heartburn and normal endoscopy who failed once daily PPIs . METHODS	Endoscopy-negative patients with heartburn who failed once daily PPIs were randomly allocated to receive 6weeks treatment of fluoxetine , omeprazole , or placebo . METHODS	Random allocation was stratified according to ambulatory pH monitoring study . METHODS	Percentage of heartburn-free days and symptom severity was assessed . RESULTS	Sixty patients with abnormal and 84 patients with normal pH test were randomized . RESULTS	Subjects receiving fluoxetine experienced more improvement in percentage of heartburn-free days ( median 35.7 , IQR 21.4-57 .1 ) than those on omeprazole ( median 7.14 , IQR 0-50 , p < 0.001 ) or placebo ( median 7.14 , IQR 0-33 .6 , p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	In normal pH subgroup , fluoxetine was superior to both omeprazole and placebo regarding percentage of heartburn-free days ( median improvement , 57.1 , IQR 35.7-57 .1 vs 13.9 , IQR , 0-45 .6 and 7.14 , 0-23 .8 , respectively , p < 0.001 ) , but no significant difference was observed between medications in abnormal pH subgroup . CONCLUSIONS	Fluoxetine was superior to omeprazole for improving the symptoms of patients with heartburn and normal endoscopy who failed once daily PPIs . CONCLUSIONS	The superiority of fluoxetine was mostly attributed to those with normal esophageal pH rather than those with abnormal pH ( ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01269788 ) ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of modulating pouch emptying ( PE ) and SI transit of glucose after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) on blood glucose , incretin hormones , glucose absorption and gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms . METHODS	Ten RYGB patients were studied twice in random order , receiving either a 150 ml glucose drink ( 200 kcal ) or the same solution infused into the proximal Roux-limb at 4 kcal/min . METHODS	Data were compared with 10 healthy volunteers who received a 4 kcal/min duodenal infusion . METHODS	PE , cecal arrival time ( CAT ) , blood glucose , plasma 3-O-methylglucose ( 3-OMG ) , insulin , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , and GI symptoms were measured . RESULTS	In RYGB subjects , the glucose drink emptied very rapidly ( PE t50 = 31 min ) and intestinal glucose infusion was associated with higher blood glucose and plasma 3-OMG , but lower plasma GLP-1 , GIP , insulin , and GI symptoms than oral glucose ( all P < 0.001 ) , and comparable to volunteers . RESULTS	In RYGB subjects , CAT correlated inversely with peak GLP-1 ( r = -0.73 , P = 0.01 ) , and plasma 3-OMG correlated tightly blood glucose ( r = 0.94 , P < 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	After RYGB , reducing intestinal glucose delivery to 4 kcal/min is associated with higher blood glucose , greater glucose absorption , lower incretin responses , and less GI symptoms , supporting rapid transit contribution to the exaggerated incretin responses and `` dumping symptoms '' ."
"OBJECTIVE	To undertake a randomised pilot study comparing biodegradable stents and endoscopic dilatation in patients with strictures . METHODS	This British multi-site study recruited seventeen symptomatic adult patients with refractory strictures . METHODS	Patients were randomised using a multicentre , blinded assessor design , comparing a biodegradable stent ( BS ) with endoscopic dilatation ( ED ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the average dysphagia score during the first 6 mo. . METHODS	Secondary endpoints included repeat endoscopic procedures , quality of life , and adverse events . METHODS	Secondary analysis included follow-up to 12 mo. . METHODS	Sensitivity analyses explored alternative estimation methods for dysphagia and multiple imputation of missing values . METHODS	Nonparametric tests were used . RESULTS	Although both groups improved , the average dysphagia scores for patients receiving stents were higher after 6 mo : BS-ED 1.17 ( 95 % CI : 0.63-1 .78 ) P = 0.029 . RESULTS	The finding was robust under different estimation methods . RESULTS	Use of additional endoscopic procedures and quality of life ( QALY ) estimates were similar for BS and ED patients at 6 and 12 mo. . RESULTS	Concomitant use of gastrointestinal prescribed medication was greater in the stent group ( BS 5.1 , ED 2.0 prescriptions ; P < 0.001 ) , as were related adverse events ( BS 1.4 , ED 0.0 events ; P = 0.024 ) . RESULTS	Groups were comparable at baseline and findings were statistically significant but numbers were small due to under-recruitment . RESULTS	The oesophageal tract has somatic sensitivity and the process of the stent dissolving , possibly unevenly , might promote discomfort or reflux . CONCLUSIONS	Stenting was associated with greater dysphagia , co-medication and adverse events . CONCLUSIONS	Rigorously conducted and adequately powered trials are needed before widespread adoption of this technology ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare effects of 2 acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on recovery quality of horses anesthetized with isoflurane . METHODS	6 horses in phase 1 , 7 horses in phase 2A , and 14 horses in phase 2B . METHODS	The study comprised 3 phases ( 2 randomized , blinded crossover phases in horses undergoing orthopedic procedures and 1 prospective dose-determining phase ) . METHODS	In phase 1 , horses were anesthetized with isoflurane and received neostigmine or saline ( 0.9 % NaCl ) solution prior to anesthetic recovery . METHODS	Phase 2A was a physostigmine dose-determining phase . METHODS	In phase 2B , horses were anesthetized with isoflurane and received neostigmine or physostigmine prior to recovery . METHODS	Objective recovery events were recorded and subjective visual analogue scale scores of recovery quality were assigned from video recordings . RESULTS	Recovery measures in phase 1 were not different between horses receiving neostigmine or saline solution . RESULTS	In phase 2A , 0.04 mg of physostigmine/kg was the highest cumulative dose that did not cause clinically relevant adverse behavioral or gastrointestinal effects . RESULTS	Horses receiving physostigmine had higher mean SD visual analogue scale recovery scores ( 70.8 13.3 mm ) than did horses receiving neostigmine ( 62.4 12.8 mm ) in phase 2B , with fewer attempts until sternal and standing recovery . RESULTS	Incidence of colic behavior did not differ among groups . CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition with physostigmine improved anesthetic recovery quality in horses anesthetized with isoflurane , compared with recovery quality for horses receiving neostigmine . CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of central muscarinic receptors by inhalation anesthetics may underlie emergence delirium in horses recovering from anesthesia ."
"OBJECTIVE	The effects of hypnosis on physiological ( gastrointestinal ) functions are incompletely understood , and it is unknown whether they are hypnosis-specific and gut-specific , or simply unspecific effects of relaxation . METHODS	Sixty-two healthy female volunteers were randomly assigned to either a single session of hypnotic suggestion of ingesting an appetizing meal and an unappetizing meal , or to relax and concentrate on having an appetizing or unappetizing meal , while the electrogastrogram ( EGG ) was recorded . METHODS	At the end of the session , participants drank water until they felt full , in order to detect EGG-signal changes after ingestion of a true gastric load . METHODS	During both conditions participants reported their subjective well-being , hunger and disgust at several time points . RESULTS	Imagining eating food induced subjective feelings of hunger and disgust as well as changes in the EGG similar to , but more pronounced than those seen with a real gastric water load during both hypnosis and relaxation conditions . RESULTS	These effects were more pronounced when imagining an appetizing meal than with an unappetizing meal . RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the hypnosis and relaxation conditions . CONCLUSIONS	Imagination with and without hypnosis exhibits similar changes in subjective and objective measures in response to imagining an appetizing and an unappetizing food , indicating high sensitivity but low specificity ."
"BACKGROUND	A limited number of nondigestible oligosaccharides are available for use in infant formula . BACKGROUND	This study evaluated growth and safety in infants fed formula supplemented with a mixture of bovine milk-derived oligosaccharides ( BMOS ) . BACKGROUND	This mixture , which was generated from whey permeate , contains galactooligosaccharides and other oligosaccharides from bovine milk , such as 3 ' - and 6 ' - sialyllactose . BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that growth in infants fed BMOS-supplemented formula would be noninferior to that in infants fed standard formula . METHODS	Healthy term infants 14days old were randomly assigned to standard formula ( control ; n = 84 ) ; standard formula with BMOS ( IF-BMOS ; n = 99 ) ; or standard formula with BMOS and probiotics ( Bifidobacterium longum , Lactobacillus rhamnosus ) ( IF-BMOS + Pro ; n = 98 ) . METHODS	A breastfed reference group was also enrolled ( n = 30 ) . METHODS	The primary outcome was mean weight gain/day from enrollment to age 4months ( noninferiority margin : -3.0 g/day ) . RESULTS	189 ( 67.3 % ) formula-fed infants were included in the primary analysis . RESULTS	Mean differences in weight gain between the control and IF-BMOS and IF-BMOS + Pro groups were < 1g/day , with 97.5 % confidence intervals above -3.0 g/day , indicating noninferior weight gain in the BMOS formula groups . RESULTS	Compared with control , infants in the BMOS groups had more frequent ( p < 0.0001 ) and less hard ( p = 0.0003 ) stools . RESULTS	No significant differences were observed between the control and BMOS groups in caregivers ' reports of flatulence , vomiting , spitting up , crying , fussing , and colic . RESULTS	When based on clinical evaluation by the investigator , the incidence of colic was higher ( p = 0.01 ) in IF-BMOS than in control ; the incidence of investigator-diagnosed colic was not significantly different in control and IF-BMOS + Pro ( p = 0.15 ) . RESULTS	Stool bifidobacteria and lactobacilli counts were higher with IF-BMOS + Pro compared with control ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas Clostridia counts were lower ( p < 0.05 ) in both BMOS groups compared with control . CONCLUSIONS	Infant formula containing BMOS either with or without probiotics provides adequate nutrition for normal growth in healthy term infants . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to fully explore the digestive tolerance of BMOS formula . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01886898 . BACKGROUND	Registered 24 June 2013 ."
"BACKGROUND	Environmental enteropathy ( EE ) is subclinical , diffuse villous atrophy characterized by T cell infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa associated with nutrient malabsorption and stunting . BACKGROUND	EE is assessed by the lactulose : mannitol ( L : M ) test , whereby nonmetabolized sugars are ingested and quantified in the urine . BACKGROUND	Multiple micronutrient ( MN ) deficiency morphologically mimics EE , and -3 ( n-3 ) polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce mucosal inflammation in Crohn disease . OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that supplementary MNs , with or without fish oil ( FO ) , would improve L : M in rural Malawian children aged 1-3 y compared with a control ( C ) group receiving a placebo . METHODS	The MNs and FO provided the Recommended Dietary Intake for 26 vitamins , minerals , eicosapentaenoic acid , and docosahexaenoic acid . METHODS	This was a 3-arm , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial , with the primary outcomes being the change in L : M ( L : M ) after 12 and 24 wk of supplementation . METHODS	Comparisons were made for L : M after 12 and 24 wk within each group by using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test , because the data are not normally distributed . RESULTS	A total of 230 children had specimens adequate for analysis ; all had an abnormal baseline L : M , defined as > 0.10 . RESULTS	After 12 wk , children who received MNs + FO had a L : M [ mean ( 95 % CI ) ] of -0.10 ( -0.04 , -0.15 ; P = 0.001 ) , and children receiving only MNs had L : M of -0.12 ( -0.03 , -0.21 ; P = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	After 24 wk , children who received MNs + FO had a L : M of -0.09 ( -0.03 , -0.15 ; P = 0.001 ) ; children receiving only MNs had a L : M of -0.11 ( -0.02 , -0.20 ; P = 0.001 ) , and the C group had L : M of -0.07 ( 0.02 , -0.16 ) ; P = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	Linear growth was similar in all groups , 4.3 cm over 24 wk . CONCLUSIONS	Although the effect was modest , these data suggest MNs can transiently ameliorate EE in rural African children . CONCLUSIONS	The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01593033 ."
"OBJECTIVE	The goals of this study were to investigate the role of a new probiotic preparation ( Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 ) in Helicobacter pylori infection . BACKGROUND	Specific probiotic strains play a role in H. pylori infection for their ability to decrease bacterial load and gastritis , prevent antibiotic-associated side effects , and increase the eradication rate . METHODS	This is a prospective , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study in a tertiary care setting . METHODS	A total of 100 H. pylori-positive naive patients received either L. reuteri combination ( 210 Colony Forming Units ) or placebo during a 3-phase study ( pre-eradication , eradication , and follow-up ) . METHODS	All underwent C urea breath test ( C-UBT ) , blood assessments of gastrin-17 ( G17 ) , endoscopy , and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale . METHODS	Eradication was confirmed by C-UBT 8 weeks after the completion of therapy . RESULTS	Fifty patients were allocated in each group . RESULTS	During pre-eradication period , C-UBT decreased by 13 % in L. reuteri combination as compared with a 4 % increase in placebo ( -13.234 % vs. 4.327 % ; P < 0.03 ) . RESULTS	During eradication , GSRS increased significantly in placebo as compared with L. reuteri combination ( 6.82.9 vs. 43.1 ; P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Significantly less patients in L. reuteri combination as compared with placebo-reported side effects ( 40.9 % vs. 62.8 % ; P < 0.04 ) . RESULTS	An abnormal G17 value was found in patients receiving placebo as compared with L. reuteri combination ( 28 % vs. 12 % ; P < 0.02 ) . RESULTS	Eradication rate was 75 % in L. reuteri combination and 65.9 % in placebo ( P = NS ) . RESULTS	L. reuteri combination increased eradication rate by 9.1 % ( odds ratio : 1.5 ) . CONCLUSIONS	L. reuteri combination alone is able to exert an inhibitory effect on H. pylori growth , and when administered with eradication therapy , it determines a significant reduction in antibiotic-associated side effects . CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , L. reuteri combination was able to decrease serum G17 levels and to ( not significantly ) increase the H. pylori-eradication rate ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate intestinal barrier function in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery using lactulose/mannitol ( L/M ) ratio measurements , and to determine correlations with early breast milk feeding . METHODS	This was a single-center , prospective , randomized pilot study of 27 term-born neonates ( 37 weeks gestation ) requiring cardiac surgery who were randomized to 1 of 2 preoperative feeding groups : nil per os ( NPO ) or trophic ( 10 mL/kg/day ) breast milk feeds . METHODS	At 3 time points ( preoperative [ preop ] , postoperative [ postop ] day 7 , and postop day 14 ) , subjects were administered an oral L/M solution , after which urine L/M ratios were measured using gas chromatography , with higher ratios indicative of increased intestinal permeability . METHODS	Trends over time in the mean urine L/M ratios for each group were estimated using a general linear mixed model . RESULTS	There were no adverse events related to preoperative trophic feeding . RESULTS	In the NPO group ( n = 13 ) , the mean urine L/M ratio was 0.06 at preop , 0.12 at postop day 7 , and 0.17 at postop day 14 . RESULTS	In the trophic breast milk feeds group ( n = 14 ) , the mean urine L/M ratio was 0.09 at preop , 0.19 at postop day 7 , and 0.15 at postop day 14 . RESULTS	In both groups , L/M ratios were significantly higher at postop day 7 and postop day 14 compared with preop ( P < .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Neonates have increased intestinal permeability after cardiac surgery extending to at least postop day 14 . CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study was not powered to detect differences in benefit or adverse events comparing the NPO and trophic breast milk feeds groups . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies to identify mechanisms of intestinal injury and therapeutic interventions are warranted . BACKGROUND	Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT01475357 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the safety and efficacy of combining oncolytic adenovirus-mediated cytotoxic gene therapy ( OAMCGT ) with intensity modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) in intermediate-risk prostate cancer . METHODS	Forty-four men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive either OAMCGT plus IMRT ( arm 1 ; n = 21 ) or IMRT only ( arm 2 ; n = 23 ) . METHODS	The primary phase 2 endpoint was acute ( 90 days ) toxicity . METHODS	Secondary endpoints included quality of life ( QOL ) , prostate biopsy ( 12-core ) positivity at 2 years , freedom from biochemical/clinical failure ( FFF ) , freedom from metastases , and survival . RESULTS	Men in arm 1 exhibited a greater incidence of low-grade influenza-like symptoms , transaminitis , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia than men in arm 2 . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal or genitourinary events or QOL between the 2 arms . RESULTS	Two-year prostate biopsies were obtained from 37 men ( 84 % ) . RESULTS	Thirty-three percent of men in arm 1 were biopsy-positive versus 58 % in arm 2 , representing a 42 % relative reduction in biopsy positivity in the investigational arm ( P = .13 ) . RESULTS	There was a 60 % relative reduction in biopsy positivity in the investigational arm in men with < 50 % positive biopsy cores at baseline ( P = .07 ) . RESULTS	To date , 1 patient in each arm exhibited biochemical failure ( arm 1 , 4.8 % ; arm 2 , 4.3 % ) . RESULTS	No patient developed hormone-refractory or metastatic disease , and none has died from prostate cancer . CONCLUSIONS	Combining OAMCGT with IMRT does not exacerbate the most common side effects of prostate radiation therapy and suggests a clinically meaningful reduction in positive biopsy results at 2 years in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer ."
"METHODS	A randomised crossover trial . OBJECTIVE	To determine the effects of a 6-week standing programme on bowel function in people with spinal cord injury . METHODS	Community , Australia and the United Kingdom . METHODS	Twenty community-dwelling people with motor complete spinal cord injury above T8 participated in a 16-week trial . METHODS	The trial consisted of a 6-week stand phase and a 6-week no-stand phase separated by a 4-week washout period . METHODS	Participants were randomised to one of two treatment sequences . METHODS	Participants allocated to the Treatment First group stood on a tilt table for 30min per session , five times per week for 6 weeks and then did not stand for the next 10 weeks . METHODS	Participants allocated to the Control First group did the opposite : they did not stand for 10 weeks and then stood for 6 weeks . METHODS	Participants in both groups received routine bowel care throughout the 16-week trial . METHODS	Assessments occurred at weeks 0 , 7 , 10 and 17 corresponding with pre and post stand and no-stand phases . METHODS	The primary outcome was Time to First Stool . METHODS	There were seven secondary outcomes reflecting other aspects of bowel function and spasticity . RESULTS	There were three dropouts leaving complete data sets on 17 participants . RESULTS	The mean ( 95 % confidence interval ) between-intervention difference for Time to First Stool was 0min ( -7 to 7 ) indicating no effect of regular standing on Time to First Stool . CONCLUSIONS	Regular standing does not reduce Time to First Stool . CONCLUSIONS	Further trials are required to test the veracity of some commonly held assumptions about the benefits of regular standing for bowel function ."
"BACKGROUND	Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) which potently neutralize a broad range of HIV isolates are potential microbicide candidates . BACKGROUND	To date , topical application of mAbs in humans and their stability in vaginal secretions has not been studied . OBJECTIVE	To assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of the mAbs 2F5 , 4E10 and 2G12 when applied vaginally in women . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase 1 trial . METHODS	Twenty-eight healthy , sexually abstinent women administered 2.5 g of gel daily for 12 days containing either 10 or 20 mg/g of each mAb ( MABGEL ) or placebo . METHODS	Main clinical evaluations and sampling occurred at baseline , 1 , 8 , and 24 hours post-1st dose and 12 and 36 hours post-12th dose . RESULTS	After adjustment for dilution factors , median levels of 2F5 , 4E10 and 2G12 in vaginal secretions at 1 hour post high-dose MABGEL were 7.74 , 5.28 and 7.48 mg/ml respectively . RESULTS	Levels of 2F5 and 4E10 declined exponentially thereafter with similar estimated half-lives ( 4.6 and 4.3 hours ) . RESULTS	In contrast , 2G12 levels declined more rapidly in the first 8 hours , with an estimated half-life of 1.4 hours during this period . RESULTS	There was no evidence of systemic absorption . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in local or systemic adverse event rates or vaginal flora changes ( by qPCR ) between active and placebo gel arms . RESULTS	Whilst at least 1 adverse event was recorded in 96 % of participants , 95 % were mild and none were serious . CONCLUSIONS	Vaginal application of 50 mg of each mAb daily was safe over a 12 day period . CONCLUSIONS	Median mAb concentrations detected at 8 hours post dose were potentially sufficient to block HIV transmission .2 G12 exhibited more rapid elimination from the human vagina than 4E10 and 2F5 , likely due to poor stability of 2G12 in acidic human vaginal secretions . CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to develop mAb-based vaginal microbicides and delivery systems . BACKGROUND	ISRCTN 64808733 UK CRN Portfolio 6470 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate effects of perirenal space blocking ( PSB ) on gastrointestinal function in patients with severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) . METHODS	Forty patients with SAP were randomly allocated to receive PSB or no PSB ( NPSB ) . METHODS	All the SAP patients received specialized medical therapy ( SMT ) . METHODS	Patients in the PSB group received PSB + SMT when hospitalized and after diagnosis , whereas patients in the NPSB group only received SMT . METHODS	A modied gastrointestinal failure ( GIF ) scoring system was used to assess the gastrointestinal function in SAP patients after admission . METHODS	Pain severity ( visual analog scale , 0 to 100 ) was monitored every 24 h for 72 h. RESULTS	Modified GIF score decreased in both groups during the 10-d study period . RESULTS	The median score decrease was initially significantly greater in the PSB group than in the NPSB group after PSB was performed . RESULTS	During the 72-h study period , pain intensity decreased in both groups . RESULTS	The median pain decrease was significantly greater in the PSB group than in the NPSB group at single time points . RESULTS	Patients in the PSB group had significantly lower incidences of hospital mortality , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome , systemic inflammatory response syndrome , and pancreatic infection , and stayed in the intensive care unit for a shorter duration . RESULTS	However , no difference in terms of operation incidence was found between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	PSB could ameliorate gastrointestinal dysfunction or failure during the early stage of SAP . CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , PSB administration could improve prognosis and decrease the mortality of SAP patients ."
"BACKGROUND	Xuezhikang ( XZK ) is an extract of fermented red yeast rice that has lipid-lowering properties . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of XZK on lipids in subjects with dyslipidemia but no coronary heart disease . METHODS	A total of 116 adults with baseline non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( non-HDL-C ) levels of approximately 208mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) levels of approximately 175mg/dL were randomized to either placebo or XZK 1200 or 2400mg daily and treated for 12weeks . RESULTS	A majority of the patients were white ( 53.4 % ) or Asian ( 37.1 % ) . RESULTS	Daily XZK 1200mg and 2400mg for 4 to 12weeks resulted in statistically significant ( P < .001 ) and clinically meaningful decreases in non-HDL-C ( 24 % reduction ) and LDL-C ( 27 % reduction ) compared with placebo . RESULTS	XZK treatment at either dose enabled approximately 50 % of subjects to reduce their LDL-C levels by30 % . RESULTS	Doubling the XZK daily dose from 1200 to 2400mg at treatment week 8 caused an additional 4.6 % reduction in LDL-C . RESULTS	Significant benefits were also observed across secondary efficacy variables , including total cholesterol ( TC ) , apolipoprotein B ( Apo B ) , triglycerides , HDL-C , the TC/HDL-C ratio , and the Apo B/Apo A-I ratio , at treatment week 8 or 12 . RESULTS	XZK was safe and well tolerated . RESULTS	Safety and tolerability profiles were similar across treatment groups . RESULTS	Most adverse events were gastrointestinal . RESULTS	No subject experienced myopathy or markedly elevated liver transaminases or creatine kinase . CONCLUSIONS	Xuezhikang significantly reduced non-HDL-C and LDL-C , and was well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	Further , longer-term studies in more diverse patient populations are needed to corroborate these findings ."
"BACKGROUND	Constipation is a frequent complaint and the combination of a prebiotic and probiotics could have a potentially synergic effect on the intestinal transit . BACKGROUND	The present study therefore aims to investigate the combination of polydextrose ( Litesse ) , L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis HN019 in a yogurt on intestinal transit in subjects who suffer from constipation . METHODS	Patients with constipation were randomly divided into two groups , Control Group ( CG ) and Treatment Group ( TG ) , and had to eat 180 ml of unflavored yogurt every morning for 14 days . METHODS	Those in the CG received only yogurt , while the TG received yogurt containing polydextrose , L. acidophilus NCFM ( ATCC 700396 ) and B. lactis HN019 ( AGAL NM97/09513 ) . RESULTS	Favourable clinical response was assessed since Agachan score had a significant reduction at the end of the study in both groups and tended to be better in the TG . RESULTS	The subjects in the treatment group also had a shorter transit time at the end of the intervention compared to the control group ( p = 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The product containing yogurt with polydextrose , B. lactis HN019 and L. acidophilus NCFM significantly shortened colonic transit time after two weeks in the TG compared to CG and may be an option for treatment of constipation ."
"OBJECTIVE	Colonoscopy is the recommended screening procedure for first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , but few studies have compared its efficacy for CRC detection with that of other screening strategies . OBJECTIVE	We conducted a controlled randomized trial to compare the efficacy of repeated fecal immunochemical tests ( FITs ) and colonoscopy in detecting advanced neoplasia ( advanced adenoma or CRC ) in family members of patients with CRC . METHODS	In a prospective study , 1918 first-degree relatives of patients with CRC were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ratio ) to receive a single colonoscopy examination or 3 FITs ( 1/year for 3 years ; OC-Sensor ; cutoff 10 g hemoglobin/g feces , corresponding to 50 ng hemoglobin/mL buffer ) . METHODS	The strategies were considered to be equivalent if the 95 % confidence interval of the difference for the detection of advanced neoplasia was 3 % . METHODS	Follow-up analyses were performed to identify false-negative FIT results and interval CRCs . RESULTS	Of all eligible asymptomatic first-degree relatives , 782 were included in the colonoscopy group and 784 in the FIT group . RESULTS	In the intention-to-screen analysis , advanced neoplasia was detected in 33 ( 4.2 % ) and 44 ( 5.6 % ) first-degree relatives in the FIT and colonoscopy groups , respectively ( odds ratio = 1.41 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.88-2 .26 ; P = .14 ) . RESULTS	In the per-protocol analysis , 28 first-degree relatives ( 3.9 % ) in the FIT group and 43 ( 5.8 % ) in the colonoscopy group had advanced neoplasia ( odds ratio = 1.56 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.95-2 .56 ; P = .08 ) . RESULTS	FIT missed 16 of 41 advanced adenomas but no CRCs . RESULTS	The FIT strategy required endoscopic evaluation of 4-fold fewer individuals to detect 1 advanced neoplasia than the colonoscopy strategy . CONCLUSIONS	Repeated FIT screening ( 1/year for 3 years ) detected all CRCs and proved equivalent to colonoscopy in detecting advanced neoplasia in first-degree relatives of patients with CRC . CONCLUSIONS	This strategy should be considered for populations where compliance with FITs is higher than with colonoscopy . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov number : NCT01075633 ( COLONFAM Study ) ."
"BACKGROUND	The incidence of nosocomial infections in children in developed countries is still high , ranging from 8 % to 30 % , and standard preventive measures , such as increased hygiene , are not sufficiently efficacious . BACKGROUND	One of the potential strategies for their prevention is the use of probiotics . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to investigate the role of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . OBJECTIVE	lactis in preventing nosocomial infections in the acute hospital setting . METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in 727 hospitalized children ( aged 1-18 y ) . METHODS	The children were randomly allocated to receive placebo ( placebo group , n = 365 ) or B. animalis subsp . METHODS	lactis at a dose of 10 ( 9 ) colony-forming units/d ( intervention group , n = 362 ) once daily for the entire duration of the hospital stay . METHODS	Nosocomial infections were defined as infections that occurred > 48 h after hospital admission and that were not present or incubating at the time of admission . RESULTS	Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis . RESULTS	There was no difference in the study primary outcome or incidence of common nosocomial gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections between groups ( 22 vs. 29 infections , respectively ; incidence rate ratio = 0.76 ; 95 % CI : 0.41 , 1.36 ; P = 0.32 ) . RESULTS	No difference was found for the duration of common nosocomial infections [ mean ( range ) : 3.58 ( 1-7 ) vs. 3.79 ( 1-8 ) d , in placebo vs. intervention group ; P = 0.74 ] . RESULTS	There was also no difference between the intervention and placebo groups for any of the other secondary outcomes ( incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections separately , duration of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections , and duration of hospitalization ) and exploratory outcomes ( gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms , severity of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections , and the use of antibiotics ) . CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study show that the use of B. animalis subsp . CONCLUSIONS	lactis failed to prevent nosocomial infections in an acute-setting pediatric hospital in children who were > 1 y of age . CONCLUSIONS	However , it should be taken into account that the overall incidence of nosocomial infections was lower than expected . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01702766 ."
"BACKGROUND	Hyperphosphatemia necessitates the use of phosphate binders in most dialysis patients . BACKGROUND	Long-term efficacy and tolerability of the iron-based phosphate binder , sucroferric oxyhydroxide ( previously known as PA21 ) , was compared with that of sevelamer carbonate ( sevelamer ) in an open-label Phase III extension study . METHODS	In the initial Phase III study , hemo - or peritoneal dialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia were randomized 2:1 to receive sucroferric oxyhydroxide 1.0-3 .0 g/day ( 2-6 tablets/day ; n = 710 ) or sevelamer 2.4-14 .4 g/day ( 3-18 tablets/day ; n = 349 ) for 24 weeks . METHODS	Eligible patients could enter the 28-week extension study , continuing the same treatment and dose they were receiving at the end of the initial study . RESULTS	Overall , 644 patients were available for efficacy analysis ( n = 384 sucroferric oxyhydroxide ; n = 260 sevelamer ) . RESULTS	Serum phosphorus concentrations were maintained during the extension study . RESULTS	Mean standard deviation ( SD ) change in serum phosphorus concentrations from extension study baseline to Week 52 end point was 0.02 0.52 mmol/L with sucroferric oxyhydroxide and 0.09 0.58 mmol/L with sevelamer . RESULTS	Mean serum phosphorus concentrations remained within Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative target range ( 1.13-1 .78 mmol/L ) for both treatment groups . RESULTS	Mean ( SD ) daily tablet number over the 28-week extension study was lower for sucroferric oxyhydroxide ( 4.0 1.5 ) versus sevelamer ( 10.1 6.6 ) . RESULTS	Patient adherence was 86.2 % with sucroferric oxyhydroxide versus 76.9 % with sevelamer . RESULTS	Mean serum ferritin concentrations increased over the extension study in both treatment groups , but transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) , iron and hemoglobin concentrations were generally stable . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal-related adverse events were similar and occurred early with both treatments , but decreased over time . CONCLUSIONS	The serum phosphorus-lowering effect of sucroferric oxyhydroxide was maintained over 1 year and associated with a lower pill burden , compared with sevelamer . CONCLUSIONS	Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was generally well tolerated long-term and there was no evidence of iron accumulation ."
"OBJECTIVE	Postoperative ileus has been considered an inevitable consequence of abdominal surgery . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of same treatments in resolving postoperative ileus in various surgical approaches . METHODS	A total of 360 patients underwent abdominal surgery , and was divided into four groups : videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy , laparotomic colo-rectal surgery , laparotomic Hartmann procedure , laparotomic gastric surgery . METHODS	In each group , patients received different postoperative treatments : chewing gum , olive oil , both , and water . METHODS	Each group was compared with a control group . RESULTS	In patients who underwent videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy , median postoperative first passage of flatus and stool in the water group was 10 and 34 hours , respectively ( P = 0.006 , P = 0.021 ) and significantly earlier than in the control group ( median postoperative 24 and 72 hours ) . RESULTS	Postoperative stay for the water group was lower ( median day 1 , 3rd interquartile 2.5 ) compared with control ( median day 3 ; 3rd interquartile 7.0 , P = 0.01 ) . RESULTS	In patients who underwent gastric surgery , median postoperative first passage of stool in the olive oil and chewing gum group was 48 hours , significantly earlier than in the control ( median postoperative hour 120 , P = 0.04 ) . RESULTS	Median time to first passage of flatus and stool was also earlier in the other groups compared with the control group , though this difference was not significant . CONCLUSIONS	Chewing gum , olive oil or both do not induce a relevant reduction of ileus after surgery . CONCLUSIONS	Water may be a safe and inexpensive option in reducing ileus . CONCLUSIONS	( United States National Institutes of Health , www.clinicaltrial.gov , number NCT01869231 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Glutamate excitotoxicity might contribute to the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . BACKGROUND	In animal models , decreased excitatory aminoacid transporter 2 ( EAAT2 ) overexpression delays disease onset and prolongs survival , and ceftriaxone increases EAAT2 activity . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ceftriaxone for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a combined phase 1 , 2 , and 3 clinical trial . METHODS	This three-stage randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was done at 59 clinical sites in the USA and Canada between Sept 4 , 2006 , and July 30 , 2012 . METHODS	Eligible adult patients had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a vital capacity of more than 60 % of that predicted for age and height , and symptom duration of less than 3 years . METHODS	In stages 1 ( pharmacokinetics ) and 2 ( safety ) , participants were randomly allocated ( 2:1 ) to ceftriaxone ( 2 g or 4 g per day ) or placebo . METHODS	In stage 3 ( efficacy ) , participants assigned to ceftriaxone in stage 2 received 4 g ceftriaxone , participants assigned to placebo in stage 2 received placebo , and new participants were randomly assigned ( 2:1 ) to 4 g ceftriaxone or placebo . METHODS	Participants , family members , and site staff were masked to treatment assignment . METHODS	Randomisation was done by a computerised randomisation sequence with permuted blocks of 3 . METHODS	Participants received 2 g ceftriaxone or placebo twice daily through a central venous catheter administered at home by a trained caregiver . METHODS	To minimise biliary side-effects , participants assigned to ceftriaxone also received 300 mg ursodeoxycholic acid twice daily and those assigned to placebo received matched placebo capsules . METHODS	The coprimary efficacy outcomes were survival and functional decline , measured as the slope of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised ( ALSFRS-R ) scores . METHODS	Analyses were by intention to treat . METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00349622 . RESULTS	Stage 3 included 66 participants from stages 1 and 2 and 448 new participants . RESULTS	In total , 340 participants were randomly allocated to ceftriaxone and 173 to placebo . RESULTS	During stages 1 and 2 , mean ALSFRS-R declined more slowly in participants who received 4 g ceftriaxone than in those on placebo ( difference 051 units per month , 95 % CI 002 to 100 ; p = 00416 ) , but in stage 3 functional decline between the treatment groups did not differ ( 009 , -006 to 024 ; p = 02370 ) . RESULTS	No significant differences in survival between the groups were recorded in stage 3 ( HR 090 , 95 % CI 071 to 115 ; p = 04146 ) . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal adverse events and hepatobiliary adverse events were more common in the ceftriaxone group than in the placebo group ( gastrointestinal , 245 of 340 [ 72 % ] ceftriaxone vs 97 of 173 [ 56 % ] placebo , p = 00004 ; hepatobiliary , 211 [ 62 % ] vs 19 [ 11 % ] , p < 00001 ) . RESULTS	Significantly more participants who received ceftriaxone had serious hepatobiliary serious adverse events ( 41 participants [ 12 % ] ) than did those who received placebo ( 0 participants ) . CONCLUSIONS	Despite promising stage 2 data , stage 3 of this trial of ceftriaxone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis did not show clinical efficacy . CONCLUSIONS	The adaptive design allowed for seamless transition from one phase to another , and central venous catheter use in the home setting was shown to be feasible .

"BACKGROUND	Urinary tract infections ( UTI ) are the most frequent bacterial infection affecting women and account for about 15 % of antibiotics prescribed in primary care . BACKGROUND	However , some women with a UTI are not prescribed antibiotics or are prescribed the wrong antibiotics , while many women who do not have a microbiologically confirmed UTI are prescribed antibiotics . BACKGROUND	Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing unnecessarily increases the risk of side effects and the development of antibiotic resistance , and wastes resources . METHODS	614 adult female patients will be recruited from four primary care research networks ( Wales , England , Spain , the Netherlands ) and individually randomised to either POCT guided care or the guideline-informed ` standard care ' arm . METHODS	Urine and stool samples ( where possible ) will be obtained at presentation ( day 1 ) and two weeks later for microbiological analysis . METHODS	All participants will be followed up on the course of their illness and their quality of life , using a 2 week self-completed symptom diary . METHODS	At 3 months , a primary care notes review will be conducted for evidence of further evidence of treatment failures , recurrence , complications , hospitalisations and health service costs . CONCLUSIONS	Although the Flexicult POCT is used in some countries in routine primary care , it 's clinical and cost effectiveness has never been evaluated in a randomised clinical trial . CONCLUSIONS	If shown to be effective , the use of this POCT could benefit individual sufferers and provide evidence for health care authorities to develop evidence based policies to combat the spread and impact of the unprecedented rise of infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria in Europe .

"BACKGROUND	We compared intestinal , hepatic , and other organ function after hepatic portal occlusion with or without dexmedetomidine administration under general anaesthesia . METHODS	In this prospective , randomized double-blind investigation , 44 patients undergoing elective hepatectomy with inflow occlusion were randomized into a dexmedetomidine group or a control group . METHODS	The dexmedetomidine group received an initial dexmedetomidine loading dose of 1 g kg ( -1 ) over 10 min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.3 g kg ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) . METHODS	In the control group , 0.9 % sodium chloride was administered . METHODS	The primary outcome was serum diamine oxidase ( DAO ) activity reflecting intestinal injury . METHODS	The secondary outcomes included variables reflecting intestinal , hepatic , kidney , and cardiopulmonary function , and biomarkers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory response . RESULTS	DAO activity was lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the control group at 6 and 24 h after liver reperfusion [ 9.77 ( 1.07 ) vs14 .29 ( 1.43 ) units ml ( -1 ) , P = 0.021 ; 9.67 ( 0.98 ) vs 13.97 ( 1.31 ) units ml ( -1 ) , P = 0.017 ] . RESULTS	d-lactate acid levels were lower during 1-72 h after liver reperfusion compared with the control group ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Also , the intestinal injury severity grade was decreased by dexmedetomidine ( P = 0.038 ) . RESULTS	The biomarkers reflecting liver injury increased over time , but were lower in the dexmedetomidine group ( all P < 0.05 ) , while the variables reflecting cardiopulmonary and renal function showed no differences between the groups ( all P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Dexmedetomidine administered perioperatively attenuates intestinal and hepatic injury in patients undergoing elective liver resection with inflow occlusion without any potential risk .

"BACKGROUND	Whole-grain ( WG ) foods have been suggested to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease , but studies are inconsistent and effects on cardiovascular risk markers are not clear . OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to assess the impact of increasing WG consumption to at least 80 g/d on overall dietary intake , body composition , blood pressure ( BP ) , blood lipids , blood glucose , gastrointestinal microbiology , and gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy , middle-aged adults with habitual WG intake < 24 g/d . METHODS	Eligible subjects [ 12 men , 21 women , aged 40-65 y , body mass index ( BMI ) : 20-35 kg/m ( 2 ) ] were identified through use of food frequency questionnaires and subsequently completed 3-day food diaries ( 3DFDs ) to confirm habitual WG consumption . METHODS	Subjects consumed diets high in WG ( > 80 g/d ) or low in WG [ < 16 g/d , refined-grain ( RG ) diet ] in a crossover study with 6-wk intervention periods separated by a 4-wk washout . METHODS	Adherence was achieved by specific dietary advice and provision of a range of cereal food products . METHODS	The 3DFDs , diet compliance diaries , and plasma alkylresorcinols were used to verify compliance . RESULTS	During the WG intervention , consumption increased from 28 g/d to 168 g/d ( P < 0.001 ) , accompanied by an increase in plasma alkylresorcinols ( P < 0.001 ) and total fiber intake ( P < 0.001 ) , without any effect on energy or other macronutrients . RESULTS	Although there were no effects on studied variables , there were trends toward increased 24-h fecal weight ( P = 0.08 ) and reduction in body weight ( P = 0.10 ) and BMI ( P = 0.08 ) during the WG intervention compared with the RG period . CONCLUSIONS	A combination of dietary advice and provision of commercially available food items enabled subjects with a low-moderate habitual consumption of WG to substantially increase their WG intake , but there was little effect on blood biochemical markers , body composition , BP , fecal measurements , or gut microbiology . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at www.controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN36521837 ."
"OBJECTIVE	The effects of glucose-and-fructose ( GF ) coingestion on cycling time trial ( TT ) performance and physiological responses to exercise were examined under postprandial conditions . METHODS	Eight trained male cyclists ( age , 25 6 yr ; height , 180 4 cm ; weight , 77 9 kg ; VO2max , 62 6 mLkgmin ) completed the study . METHODS	Subjects ingested either an artificially sweetened placebo ( PL ) , a moderate-glucose beverage ( MG , 1.03 gmin ) , a high-glucose beverage ( HG , 1.55 gmin ) , or a GF beverage ( 1.55 gmin , 2:1 ratio ) during approximately 3 h of exercise , including 2 h of constant-load cycling ( 55 % Wmax , 195 17 W ) , immediately followed by a computer-simulated 30-km TT . METHODS	Physiological responses ( VE , VO2 , RER , HR , blood glucose level , blood lactate level , and RPE ) and incidences of gastrointestinal distress were assessed during early ( 15-20 min ) , middle ( 55-60 min ) , and late exercise ( 115-120 min ) and during the TT . METHODS	Magnitude-based qualitative inferences were used to evaluate differences between treatments . RESULTS	In comparison with that in PL ( 52.9 3.7 min ) , TT performances were faster with GF ( 50.4 2.2 min , `` very likely '' benefit ) , MG ( 51.1 2.4 min , `` likely '' benefit ) , and HG ( 52.0 3.7 min , `` possible '' benefit ) . RESULTS	GF resulted in a `` likely '' improvement versus HG ( 3.0 % ) and an `` unclear '' effect relative to MG ( 1.2 % ) . RESULTS	MG was `` possibly '' beneficial versus HG ( 1.8 % ) .

"OBJECTIVE	This study aims to investigate and evaluate the efficacy and safety of early enteral nutrition ( EN ) in maintaining and improving the postoperative nutritional status in patients undergoing esophagectomy . METHODS	A randomized , controlled clinical trial was conducted in 120 adult patients with esophageal cancer and undergoing esophagectomy . METHODS	Patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving either EN ( N. = 64 ) or parenteral nutrition ( PN ) ( N. = 56 ) postoperatively . METHODS	The nutritional intake was isonitrogenic and isocalorie for both groups . METHODS	Nutritional status was evaluated preoperatively as well as on postoperative day I and day 8 . METHODS	Daily nitrogen balance was measured and 7-day cumulative nitrogen balance was calculated . METHODS	The levels of serum markers including d-lactate , diamine oxidase ( DAO ) , and endotoxin were determined on 1st , 4th and 8th postoperative day for analyzing intestinal barrier function . METHODS	Postoperative infection rate and the incidence of nutrition support-related complications were examined . RESULTS	The concentrations of serum albumin and prealbumin in patients of EN group were significantly higher than those in PN group and the concentrations of blood glucose , - GT , AKP , TB , and DB were significantly lower compared to those in the PN group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Both daily nitrogen balance and cumulative nitrogen balance of EN group were better than those of PN group since postoperative day III . RESULTS	The serum levels of d-lactate , DAO , and endotoxin of EN group were significantly lower than those of PN group on postoperative day VIII ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	The incidence of postoperative infections in blood , lung , and intestinal tract in EN group was lower compared to PN group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	No severe complications associated with nutritional support occurred in EN group . RESULTS	The time to flatus passage in EN group was significantly shorter , and the cost of nutritional support was significantly less compared to PN group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Postoperative early enteral nutrition was safe and feasible for patients undergoing esophagectomy . CONCLUSIONS	Compared to PN , EN more efficiently ameliorated postoperational nutritional status of the patients undergoing esophagectomy , played an important role in restoring intestinal barrier function postoperatively , reduced the incidence of postoperative infection , and decreased the cost of hospital stay ."
"BACKGROUND	Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) is characterized by heterogeneous pathophysiology and low response to treatment . BACKGROUND	Up to 60 % of IBS patients suffers from visceral hypersensitivity , which is associated with symptom severity and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms . BACKGROUND	Recently , positive effects of probiotics in IBS have been reported , but overall the response was modest . BACKGROUND	We performed a study in IBS patients , characterized by visceral hypersensitivity measured with the rectal barostat , aiming to assess the effect of 6weeks of multispecies probiotic mix on visceral pain perception . METHODS	We conducted a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial in forty Rome III IBS patients with visceral hypersensitivity . METHODS	Prior to intake , patients kept a 2-week symptom diary and underwent a rectal barostat measurement . METHODS	When hypersensitivity was confirmed , participation was allowed and patients received a multispecies probiotic with in vitro proven potential beneficial effects on mechanisms contributing to visceral hypersensitivity ( six different probiotic strains ; 10 ( 9 ) cfu/g ) , or a placebo product of one sachet ( 5g ) per day for 6weeks . METHODS	At the end of the intervention period , visceroperception and symptoms were reassessed . RESULTS	Thirty-five patients completed the trial . RESULTS	The percentage of patients with visceral hypersensitivity decreased significantly in the probiotic and placebo group ( 76.5 % and 71.4 % , respectively ; N.S. between groups ) . RESULTS	Improvement in pain scores and mean symptom score did not differ between the probiotic and placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	In this placebo-controlled trial in IBS patients with visceral hypersensitivity , no significant effect of a multispecies probiotic on viscerperception was observed . CONCLUSIONS	The study has been registered in the US National Library of Medicine ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT00702026 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Feeding polyphenol-rich plant products has been shown to increase the gain : feed ratio in growing pigs . BACKGROUND	The reason for this finding has not yet been elucidated . BACKGROUND	In order to find the reasons for an increase of the gain : feed ratio , this study investigated the effect of two polyphenol-rich dietary supplements , grape seed and grape marc meal extract ( GSGME ) or spent hops ( SH ) , on gut morphology , apparent digestibility of nutrients , microbial composition in faeces and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the intestine of pigs . RESULTS	Pigs fed GSGME or SH showed an improved gain : feed ratio in comparison to the control group ( P < 0.10 for GSGME , P < 0.05 for SH ) . RESULTS	Villus height : crypt depth ratio in duodenum and jejunum as well as apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients were unchanged in the groups receiving GSGME or SH in comparison to the control group . RESULTS	However , the groups receiving GSGME or SH revealed an increased faecal pH value , lower levels of volatile fatty acids and lower counts of Streptococcus spp . RESULTS	and Clostridium Cluster XIVa in the faecal microbiota ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Moreover , both treatment groups had a lower expression of various pro-inflammatory genes in duodenum , ileum and colon than the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The present study suggests that dietary plant products rich in polyphenols are able to improve the gain : feed ratio in growing pigs . CONCLUSIONS	It is assumed that an alteration in the microbial composition and anti-inflammatory effects of the polyphenol-rich plant products in the intestine might contribute to this effect ."
"OBJECTIVE	Splanchnic hypoperfusion is a physiological phenomenon during strenuous exercise . OBJECTIVE	It has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal injury and may hamper athletic performance . OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that L-citrulline supplementation improves splanchnic perfusion and decreases intestinal injury by enhancing arginine availability . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of L-citrulline intake on splanchnic perfusion , intestinal injury , and barrier function during exercise . METHODS	In this randomized , double-blind crossover study , 10 men cycled for 60 min at 70 % of their maximum workload after L-citrulline ( 10 g ) or placebo ( L-alanine ) intake . METHODS	Splanchnic perfusion was assessed using gastric air tonometry . METHODS	Sublingual microcirculation was evaluated by sidestream dark field imaging . METHODS	Plasma amino acid levels and intestinal fatty acid binding protein concentrations , reflecting enterocyte damage , were assessed every 10 min . METHODS	Urinary excretion of sugar probes was measured to evaluate intestinal permeability changes . RESULTS	Oral L-citrulline supplementation enhanced plasma citrulline ( 1840.3 142.3 M ) and arginine levels ( 238.5 9.1 M ) compared with that in placebo ( 45.7 4.8 M and 101.5 6.1 M , respectively , P < 0.0001 ) , resulting in increased arginine availability . RESULTS	Splanchnic hypoperfusion was prevented during exercise after L-citrulline ingestion ( reflected by unaltered gapg-apCO2 levels ) , whereas gapg-apCO2 increased with placebo treatment ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Accordingly , L-citrulline intake resulted in an increased number of perfused small sublingual vessels compared with that in placebo ( 7.8 6.0 vs -2.0 2.4 , P = 0.06 ) . RESULTS	Furthermore , plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels were attenuated during exercise after L-citrulline supplementation compared with that in placebo ( AUC0-60 min , -185 % 506 % vs 1318 % 553 % , P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	No significant differences were observed for intestinal permeability . CONCLUSIONS	Pre-exercise L-citrulline intake preserves splanchnic perfusion and attenuates intestinal injury during exercise in athletes compared with placebo , probably by enhancing arginine availability . CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that oral L-citrulline supplementation is a promising intervention to combat splanchnic hypoperfusion-induced intestinal compromise ."
"BACKGROUND	Patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) show an increase in bowel aerobic bacteria that produce uremic toxins and decreased anaerobic bacteria as bifidobacteria and lactobacillus . BACKGROUND	The latter can be used as probiotics . BACKGROUND	The probiotic with greater availability in Mexico , is the lactobacillus casei shirota ( LcS ) , currently there is no known LcS specified dose that produces a benefit to the patient with CKD . OBJECTIVE	To determine the effectiveness of two different LcS doses in achieving a decrease in urea concentrations of at least 10 % in patients with KDOQI stage 3 and stage 4 CKD . OBJECTIVE	METODOLOGY : A simple randomized , controlled clinical trial . OBJECTIVE	Outpatients treated at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubirn in Mxico D.F. Patients were provided the LcS , as follows : Group A : 8 x 10 ( 9 ) colony-forming units ( CFU ) and Group B : 16 x 10 ( 9 ) CFU . OBJECTIVE	Patients were followed-up for eight weeks , and baseline and final samples were obtained to calculate the basal and final concentrations , respectively , of blood urea and serum creatinine ( CrS ) . OBJECTIVE	During the follow-up , both groups consumed a diet of 30 kcal/kg/weight and 0.8 g/kg/weight of protein , and a food diary was made to assess both the adherence to the diet and LcS . RESULTS	Thirty patients with CKD were evaluated . RESULTS	When analyzing the percentage change between the different doses , a decrease > 10 % was found in the blood urea concentrations for patients treated with the 16 x 109 dose , which was significant with respect to the baseline measurement . CONCLUSIONS	There was a > 10 % decrease in the serum urea concentrations with LcS in patients with stage 3 and 4 CRF ."
"BACKGROUND	Unintended pregnancy remains a serious public health challenge in the USA . BACKGROUND	We assessed the effects of an intervention to increase patients ' access to long-acting reversible contraceptives ( LARCs ) on pregnancy rates . METHODS	We did a cluster randomised trial in 40 reproductive health clinics across the USA in 2011-13 .20 clinics were randomly assigned to receive evidence-based training on providing counselling and insertion of intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) or progestin implants and 20 to provide standard care . METHODS	Usual costs for contraception were maintained at all sites . METHODS	We recruited women aged 18-25 years attending family planning or abortion care visits and not desiring pregnancy in the next 12 months . METHODS	The primary outcome was selection of an IUD or implant at the clinic visit and secondary outcome was pregnancy within 12 months . METHODS	We used generalised estimating equations for clustered data to measure the intervention effect on contraceptive selection , and used survival analysis to assess pregnancy rates . RESULTS	Of 1500 women enrolled , more at intervention than control sites reported receiving counselling on IUDs or implants ( 565 [ 71 % ] of 797 vs 271 [ 39 % ] of 693 , odds ratio 38 , 95 % CI 28-52 ) and more selected LARCs during the clinic visit ( 224 [ 28 % ] vs 117 [ 17 % ] , 19 , 13-28 ) . RESULTS	The pregnancy rate was lower in intervention group than in the control group after family planning visits ( 79 vs 154 per 100 person-years ) , but not after abortion visits ( 265 vs 223 per 100 person-years ) . RESULTS	We found a significant intervention effect on pregnancy rates in women attending family planning visits ( hazard ratio 054 , 95 % CI 034-085 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The pregnancy rate can be reduced by provision of counselling on long-term reversible contraception and access to devices during family planning counselling visits .

"OBJECTIVE	To explore the feasibility , advantages and clinical value of gasless abdominal-wall lifting laparoscopic myomectomy with 5 mm laparoscope and 2 abdominal holes ( 1.5-hole-gasless-laparoscopic myomectomy ) . METHODS	A total of 90 cases of uterine fibroids were randomly divided into 2 groups . METHODS	Lifting gasless group ( n = 46 ) underwent gasless abdominal-wall lifting laparoscopic myomectomy with 5 mm laparoscope and 2 abdominal holes , and pneumoperitoneum group ( n = 44 ) pneumoperitoneum laparoscopic myomectomy . METHODS	The operative duration , blood loss volume , average time of single-myoma-removal , intestinal function recovery and hospital stay of both groups were compared . RESULTS	The operative duration , blood loss volume and average time of single-myoma-removal of lifting gasless group were respectively significantly less than those of pneumoperitoneum group ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	The postoperative intestinal function recovery and postoperative hospital stay had no significant difference between two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Three cases of pneumoperitoneum group were converted successfully into myomectomy with traditional 3-hole gasless abdominal wall lifting laparoscopy because of large fibroids in uterine isthmus . RESULTS	A total of 12 newly discovered myomas , not pre-detected ultrasonically , were removed in 10 cases of lifting gasless group . CONCLUSIONS	1.5-hole-gasless-laparoscopic myomectomy , like traditional gasless laparoscopy , may avoid the complications of laparoscopic CO2 pneumoperitoneum . CONCLUSIONS	The smaller laparoscope-hole and sole operating hole make this maneuver a safe , easy and mini-invasive procedure . CONCLUSIONS	It is more suitable for clinical application and popularity in primary care ."
"BACKGROUND	In the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( ACS NSQIP ) , pancreatic fistula has not been monitored , although organ space infection ( OSI ) data are collected . BACKGROUND	Therefore , the purpose of this analysis was to determine the relationship between ACS NSQIP organ space infection and pancreatic fistulas . METHODS	From 2007 to 2011 , 976 pancreatic resection patients were monitored via ACS NSQIP at our institution . METHODS	From this database , 250 patients were randomly chosen for further analysis . METHODS	Four patients were excluded because they underwent total pancreatectomy . METHODS	Data on OSI were gathered prospectively . METHODS	Data on pancreatic fistulas and other intra-abdominal complications were determined retrospectively . RESULTS	Organ space infections ( OSIs ) were documented in 22 patients ( 8.9 % ) . RESULTS	Grades B ( n = 26 ) and C ( n = 5 ) pancreatic fistulas occurred in 31 patients ( 12.4 % ) ; grade A fistulas were observed in 38 patients ( 15.2 % ) . RESULTS	Bile leaks and gastrointestinal ( GI ) anastomotic leaks each developed in 5 ( 2.0 % ) patients . RESULTS	Only 17 of 31 grade B and C pancreatic fistulas ( 55 % ) , and none of 38 grade A fistulas were classified as OSIs in ACS NSQIP . RESULTS	In addition , only 2 of 5 bile leaks ( 40 % ) and 2 of 5 GI anastomotic leaks ( 40 % ) were OSIs . RESULTS	Moreover , 3 OSIs were due to bacterial peritonitis , a chyle leak , and an ischemic bowel . CONCLUSIONS	This analysis suggests that the sensitivity ( 55 % ) and specificity ( 45 % ) of organ space infection ( OSI ) in ACS NSQIP are too low for OSI to be a surrogate for grade B and C pancreatic fistulas . CONCLUSIONS	We concluded that procedure-specific variables will be required for ACS NSQIP to improve outcomes after pancreatectomy ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the efficacy and safety of oral azithromycin compared with oral doxycycline in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) who had failed to respond to prior conservative management . METHODS	110 patients ( > 12years old ) with MGD were randomly assigned to receive either oral 5-day azithromycin ( 500mg on day 1 and then 250mg/day ) or 1-month doxycycline ( 200mg/day ) . METHODS	They also continued eyelid warming/cleaning and artificial tears . METHODS	A score comprising five symptoms and seven signs ( primary outcome ) was recorded prior to treatment and at 1week , and 1 and 2months after treatment . METHODS	Total score was the sum of both scores at each follow-up . METHODS	Side effects were recorded and overall clinical improvement was categorised as excellent , good , fair or poor based on the percentage of change in the total score . RESULTS	Symptoms and signs improved significantly in both groups ( p = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	While improvement of symptoms was not different between the groups , bulbar conjunctival redness ( p = 0.004 ) and ocular surface staining ( p = 0.01 ) were significantly better in the azithromycin group . RESULTS	The azithromycin group showed a significantly better overall clinical response ( p = 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Mild gastrointestinal side effects were not significantly different between the groups except for the second visit , when the doxycycline group had significantly more side effects ( p = 0.002 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Although both oral azithromycin and doxycycline improved the symptoms of MGD , 5-day oral azithromycin is recommended for its better effect on improving the signs , better overall clinical response and shorter duration of treatment .

"BACKGROUND	Hypokalaemia is frequently encountered in the daily clinical practices of a paediatric cardiac intensive care unit ( PCICU ) . BACKGROUND	It is a strong independent predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure . BACKGROUND	Thus , prompt potassium replacement therapy holds pivotal importance in therapy for hypokalaemia . BACKGROUND	Although intravenous potassium replacement ( IVPR ) in hypokalaemia is the preferred route in most intensive care settings , it is associated with known safety risks and can lead to arrhythmias , cardiac arrest and death if inappropriately administered . BACKGROUND	Enteral potassium replacement ( EPR ) , with its superior safety profile , may be a better alternative to IVPR . RESULTS	Primary outcome To compare the efficacy EPR and IVPR for treatment of hypokalaemia . RESULTS	Secondary outcome measures include a comparison of adverse effects ( hyperkalaemia , diarrhoea , gastrointestinal bleeds , nausea and vomiting ) after EPR and IVPR and a comparison of the number of dose/s required to achieve resolution of hypokalaemia for each episode of hypokalaemia . METHODS	The Enteral Versus Intravenous Potassium Supplementation trial is designed as a randomised , controlled , non-blinded trial with two arms . METHODS	Intervention arms will be block randomised on alternate weeks for IVPR and EPR . METHODS	Recruited patients will receive treatment accordingly . METHODS	For analysis , the percentage change in serum potassium levels in mEq/L after each event of potassium replacement in both arms will be used as an end point to compare the efficacy EPR and IVPR for treatment of hypokalaemia . METHODS	The study will be conducted at the PCICU at the Aga Khan University Hospital , Karachi . BACKGROUND	This study has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee and Clinical Trials Unit at The Aga Khan University with respect to scientific content and compliance with applicable research and human subjects regulations .

"BACKGROUND	Local analgesia through wound catheters is used as a part of multimodal analgesia . BACKGROUND	The efficacy of continuous subfascial wound infusion compared to epidural analgesia is unknown for abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( TAH-BSO ) via Pfannenstiel incision . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare the aforementioned two methods in this type of surgery for postoperative morphine consumption , acute and persistent postsurgical pain . METHODS	Fifty patients enrolled in the study were randomly allocated to receive continuous 10 mL/h levobupivacaine either via subfascial ( Group S ) or epidural ( Group E ) catheter for 48 h postoperatively . METHODS	In Group S 0.25 % levobupivacaine was used for the first six hours and 0.125 % thereafter , whereas Group E received 0.125 % levobupivacaine throughout the study period . METHODS	Cumulative morphine consumption , static and dynamic pain , gastrointestinal recovery , ambulation , patient satisfaction , hospital stay , as well as pain at 2nd and 6th months were evaluated . RESULTS	Group S was superior to Group E regarding cumulative morphine consumption ( 16.87.2 mg and 28.710.3 mg respectively , P < 0.001 ; mean difference -11.9 with 95 % CI of the difference -17.1 to -6.7 ) and pain relief . RESULTS	Patient satisfaction was higher in Group S compared to Group E ( P = 0.006 ) . RESULTS	Less postoperative vomiting was observed in Group S. No difference was detected in length of hospital stay and persistent postsurgical pain incidence . CONCLUSIONS	Wound analgesia via subfascial catheter with continuous levobupivacaine infusion decreases postoperative morphine consumption and increases patient satisfaction compared to epidural analgesia with no difference in persistent postsurgical pain following TAH-BSO via Pfannenstiel incision ."
"BACKGROUND	The alginate-antacid , Gaviscon Double Action ( Gaviscon DA ; Reckitt Benckiser , Slough , UK ) suppresses reflux after meals by creating a gel-like barrier that caps and displaces the acid pocket distal to the oesophago-gastric junction . BACKGROUND	The effect of Gaviscon DA on reflux and dyspepsia symptoms has not yet been demonstrated with a modern trial design . OBJECTIVE	A pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of Gaviscon DA compared with matched placebo for decreasing upper gastrointestinal symptoms in symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) patients . METHODS	A randomised , double-blind , parallel group study was performed in 110 patients with symptoms of GERD . METHODS	Patients received Gaviscon DA or placebo tablets for 7 consecutive days . METHODS	The primary endpoint compared the change in overall Reflux Disease Questionnaire ( RDQ ) symptom score ( combined heartburn/regurgitation/dyspepsia ) . METHODS	Secondary endpoints assessed individual dimensions , GERD dimension ( heartburn and regurgitation ) and overall treatment evaluation ( OTE ) . RESULTS	There was a greater decrease in overall RDQ symptom score in the Gaviscon DA group compared with the placebo group ( Least Squares Mean difference -0.55 ; P = 0.0033 ) , and for each of the dimensions independently . RESULTS	Patients in the Gaviscon DA group evaluated their overall treatment response higher than patients in the placebo group [ mean ( standard deviation ) OTE 4.1 ( 2.44 ) vs. 1.9 ( 3.34 ) ; P = 0.0005 ] . RESULTS	No differences in the incidence of adverse events were observed between treatment groups . CONCLUSIONS	Gaviscon DA decreases reflux and dyspeptic symptoms in GERD patients compared with matched placebo and has a favourable benefit-risk balance . CONCLUSIONS	Larger scale clinical investigations of medications targeting the acid pocket are warranted . CONCLUSIONS	( EudraCT , 2012-002188-84 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Small studies suggest peanut oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) might be effective in the treatment of peanut allergy . BACKGROUND	We aimed to establish the efficacy of OIT for the desensitisation of children with allergy to peanuts . METHODS	We did a randomised controlled crossover trial to compare the efficacy of active OIT ( using characterised peanut flour ; protein doses of 2-800 mg/day ) with control ( peanut avoidance , the present standard of care ) at the NIHR/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Clinical Research Facility ( Cambridge , UK ) . METHODS	Randomisation ( 1:1 ) was by use of an audited online system ; group allocation was not masked . METHODS	Eligible participants were aged 7-16 years with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction after peanut ingestion , positive skin prick test to peanuts , and positive by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) . METHODS	We excluded participants if they had a major chronic illness , if the care provider or a present household member had suspected or diagnosed allergy to peanuts , or if there was an unwillingness or inability to comply with study procedures . METHODS	Our primary outcome was desensitisation , defined as negative peanut challenge ( 1400 mg protein in DBPCFC ) at 6 months ( first phase ) . METHODS	Control participants underwent OIT during the second phase , with subsequent DBPCFC . METHODS	Immunological parameters and disease-specific quality-of-life scores were measured . METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat . METHODS	Fisher 's exact test was used to compare the proportion of those with desensitisation to peanut after 6 months between the active and control group at the end of the first phase . METHODS	This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials , number ISRCTN62416244 . RESULTS	The primary outcome , desensitisation , was recorded for 62 % ( 24 of 39 participants ; 95 % CI 45-78 ) in the active group and none of the control group after the first phase ( 0 of 46 ; 95 % CI 0-9 ; p < 0001 ) . RESULTS	84 % ( 95 % CI 70-93 ) of the active group tolerated daily ingestion of 800 mg protein ( equivalent to roughly five peanuts ) . RESULTS	Median increase in peanut threshold after OIT was 1345 mg ( range 45-1400 ; p < 0001 ) or 255 times ( range 182-280 ; p < 0001 ) . RESULTS	After the second phase , 54 % ( 95 % CI 35-72 ) tolerated 1400 mg challenge ( equivalent to roughly ten peanuts ) and 91 % ( 79-98 ) tolerated daily ingestion of 800 mg protein . RESULTS	Quality-of-life scores improved ( decreased ) after OIT ( median change -161 ; p < 0001 ) . RESULTS	Side-effects were mild in most participants . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal symptoms were , collectively , most common ( 31 participants with nausea , 31 with vomiting , and one with diarrhoea ) , then oral pruritus after 63 % of doses ( 76 participants ) and wheeze after 041 % of doses ( 21 participants ) . RESULTS	Intramuscular adrenaline was used after 001 % of doses ( one participant ) . CONCLUSIONS	OIT successfully induced desensitisation in most children within the study population with peanut allergy of any severity , with a clinically meaningful increase in peanut threshold . CONCLUSIONS	Quality of life improved after intervention and there was a good safety profile . CONCLUSIONS	Immunological changes corresponded with clinical desensitisation .

"BACKGROUND	Simethicone and N-acetylcysteine have been widely used in improving endoscopic visibility . BACKGROUND	However , the optimal dose , volume , and dosing time for the premedication regimen are still unclear . OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to assess the efficacy of premedication in improving endoscopic visibility and determine the contributions of dose , volume , and premedication time . METHODS	A total of 1849 patients were prospectively treated in three groups : group A : 100-mg simethicone suspension in 5 mL water ; group B : 100-mg simethicone suspension in 100 mL water ; and group C : 100-mg simethicone suspension in 100 mL water containing 200 mg N-acetylcysteine . METHODS	Mucosa visibility was assessed at seven sites of upper gastrointestinal tract . METHODS	The sum of scores was considered as total mucosal visibility score ( TMVS ) . RESULTS	The upper body of stomach had the worst visibility score for all groups . RESULTS	TMVS of groups B and C were significantly lower than those of group A. Group C had a significantly fewer patients requiring endoscopic flushing than groups A and B. RESULTS	The TMVS for groups B and C were significantly lower than for group A within 30 min of beginning premedication . RESULTS	Beyond 30 min of premedication , there was no significant difference in the TMVS among groups . CONCLUSIONS	Premedication using 100 mg simethicone in 100 mL of water improves endoscopic visibility . CONCLUSIONS	Addition of N-acetylcysteine to simethicone in 100 mL of water reduces the need for endoscopic flushing . CONCLUSIONS	For patients unable to tolerate a large fluid volume , a 5-mL simethicone suspension administered more than 30 min prior to upper endoscopy is suggested ."

"OBJECTIVE	Rifaximin is a gut-selective , oral antimicrobial agent shown to reduce the recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) and HE-related hospitalizations in a 6-month , randomized , controlled trial ( RCT ) . OBJECTIVE	We performed a phase 3 , open-label maintenance study to assess the safety and rate of hospitalization with long-term rifaximin use . METHODS	We conducted a 24-month , open-label maintenance study of rifaximin ( 550 mg , twice daily ) in patients with HE who participated in the previous RCT of rifaximin or new patients enrolled from March 2007 to December 2010 . METHODS	Safety was assessed ( adverse events , clinical laboratory parameters ) for the integrated population of all patients , who were given rifaximin 550 mg twice daily ( all-rifaximin population , N = 392 ) . METHODS	Safety and hospitalization data were compared between the group given placebo in the original RCT ( n = 159 ) and those given rifaximin ( n = 140 ) . RESULTS	In the all-rifaximin population , the median exposure to rifaximin was 427.0 days ( range , 2-1427 d ) , with 510.5 person-years of exposure . RESULTS	The profile and rate of adverse events with long-term rifaximin treatment were similar to those of the original RCT . RESULTS	There was no increase in the rate of infections , including with Clostridium difficile , or development of bacterial antibiotic resistance . RESULTS	Rates of hospitalizations with long-term rifaximin administration remained low : the HE-related hospitalization rate , normalized for exposure ( 0.21 ; all-rifaximin population ) , was similar to that of the rifaximin group in the original RCT ( 0.30 ) , and lower than that for the placebo group ( 0.72 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term treatment ( 24 mo ) with rifaximin ( 550 mg , twice daily ) appears to provide a continued reduction in the rate of HE-related and all-cause hospitalization , without an increased rate of adverse events . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov number : NCT00686920 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To explore the effect of high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) for the treatment of neurological pulmonary edema ( NPE ) in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation , and to look for the best mechanical ventilation strategy to improve the prognosis . METHODS	A prospective study was conducted , and 120 patients with NEP admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medical University from January 2010 to August 2013 were enrolled and divided into two groups according to random number table ( n = 60 in each group ) . METHODS	The patients in two groups were given empiric treatment for the disease , and they underwent mechanical ventilation . METHODS	In the normal PEEP group PEEP was 3-10 cmH2O ( 1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa ) , and in the high PEEP group PEEP was 11-30 cmH2O , and all the rest parameters were the same . METHODS	Clinical indices before and 7 days after treatment , and 28-day morality rate were compared between two groups .

"OBJECTIVE	To determine the impact of late radiation-induced toxicity on health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) among patients with prostate cancer . METHODS	The study sample was composed of 227 patients , treated with external beam radiotherapy . METHODS	Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 were used to grade late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity . METHODS	The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire C30 ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) was used to assess HRQoL at baseline , and 6 , 12 and 24 months after completion of radiotherapy . METHODS	Statistical analysis was performed using a multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) . RESULTS	Urinary incontinence and rectal discomfort significantly affected HRQoL . RESULTS	The impact of urinary incontinence on HRQoL was most pronounced 6 months after radiotherapy and gradually decreased over time . RESULTS	The impact of rectal discomfort on HRQoL was predominant at 6 months after radiotherapy , decreased at 12 months and increased again 2 years after radiotherapy . RESULTS	No significant impact on HRQoL was observed for any of the other toxicity endpoints , or non-toxicity related factors such as hormonal therapy , radiotherapy technique or age . CONCLUSIONS	Urinary incontinence and rectal discomfort have a significant impact on HRQoL . CONCLUSIONS	Prevention of these side effects may likely improve quality of life of prostate cancer patients after completion of treatment ."
"OBJECTIVE	Cow 's milk protein allergy ( CMPA ) is treated using an elimination diet with an extensive protein hydrolysate . OBJECTIVE	We explored whether a thickened or nonthickened version was best for infants with suspected CMPA , which commonly causes regurgitation/vomiting . METHODS	Diagnosis of CMPA was based on a positive challenge test . METHODS	We compared the efficacy of two casein extensive hydrolysates ( eCH ) , a nonthickened version ( NT-eCH ) and a thickened version ( T-eCH ) , using a symptom-based score covering regurgitation , crying , stool consistency , eczema , urticarial and respiratory symptoms . RESULTS	A challenge was performed in 52/72 infants with suspected CMPA and was positive in 65.4 % . RESULTS	All confirmed CMPA cases tolerated eCH . RESULTS	The symptom-based score decreased significantly in all infants within a month , and the highest reduction was in those with confirmed CMPA . RESULTS	Regurgitation was reduced in all infants ( 6.43.2-2 .82.9 , p < 0.001 ) , but fell more with the T-eCH ( -4.23.2 regurgitations/day vs. -3.04.5 , ns ) , especially in infants with a negative challenge ( -3.94.0 vs. -1.93.4 , ns ) . CONCLUSIONS	eCH fulfilled the criteria for a hypoallergenic formula , and the NT-eCH and T-eCH formulas both reduced CMPA symptoms . CONCLUSIONS	The symptom-based score is useful for evaluating how effective dietary treatments are for CMPA ."
"BACKGROUND	Plantago ovata husk therapy could be used in patients with Parkinson disease to reduce the symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders , but it is important to know whether this compound modifies levodopa pharmacokinetics . BACKGROUND	The maintenance of constant plasma concentrations of levodopa abolishes the clinical fluctuations in parkinsonian patients . BACKGROUND	The aim of this randomised clinical trial was to establish the influence of the fiber Plantago ovata husk in the pharmacokinetics of levodopa when administered to Parkinson patients well controlled by their oral medication . METHODS	To evaluate the effects of this fiber on several biochemical parameters . METHODS	18 volunteers participated in the study and received alternatively two treatments ( Plantago ovata husk or placebo ) with their usual levodopa/carbidopa oral dose . METHODS	On days 0 ( initial situation ) , 14 and 35 of the study , blood samples were taken to assess levodopa pharmacokinetics and to determine biochemical parameters . RESULTS	Levodopa Cmax was very similar in the initial situation ( 603.2 ng/ml ) and after placebo administration ( 612.0 ng/ml ) , being slightly lower ( 547.8 ng/ml ) when Plantago ovata husk was given . RESULTS	AUC was very similar in the three groups : initial situation . RESULTS	- 62.87 g.min / ml , fiber treatment . RESULTS	- 64.47 g.min / ml and placebo treatment . RESULTS	- 65.10 g.min / ml . RESULTS	Fiber reduced significantly the number of peaks observed in the levodopa concentrations , maintaining concentrations more stable . RESULTS	No significant differences were found in total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides with the administration of Plantago ovata husk . CONCLUSIONS	Plantago ovata husk administration caused a smoothing and homogenization of levodopa absorption , providing more stable concentrations and final higher levels , resulting in a great benefit for patients .

"BACKGROUND	The CORONIS Trial was a 22222 non-regular , fractional , factorial trial of five pairs of alternative caesarean section surgical techniques on a range of short-term outcomes , the primary outcome being a composite of maternal death or infectious morbidity . BACKGROUND	The consequences of different surgical techniques on longer term outcomes have not been well assessed in previous studies . BACKGROUND	Such outcomes include those related to subsequent pregnancy : mode of delivery ; abnormal placentation ( e.g. accreta ) ; postpartum hysterectomy , as well as longer term pelvic problems : pain , urinary problems , infertility . BACKGROUND	The Coronis Follow-up Study aims to measure and compare the incidence of these outcomes between the randomised groups at around three years after women participated in the CORONIS Trial . METHODS	This study will assess the following null hypotheses : In women who underwent delivery by caesarean section , no differences will be detected with respect to a range of long-term outcomes when comparing the following five pairs of alternative surgical techniques evaluated in the CORONIS Trial : 1 . METHODS	Blunt versus sharp abdominal entry . METHODS	2 . METHODS	Exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair . METHODS	3 . METHODS	Single versus double layer closure of the uterus . METHODS	4 . METHODS	Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum ( pelvic and parietal ) . METHODS	5 . METHODS	Chromic catgut versus Polyglactin-910 for uterine repair . METHODS	The outcomes will include ( 1 ) women 's health : pelvic pain ; dysmenorrhoea ; deep dyspareunia ; urinary symptoms ; laparoscopy ; hysterectomy ; tubal/ovarian surgery ; abdominal hernias ; bowel obstruction ; infertility ; death . METHODS	( 2 ) Outcomes of subsequent pregnancies : inter-pregnancy interval ; pregnancy outcome ; gestation at delivery ; mode of delivery ; pregnancy complications ; surgery during or following delivery . CONCLUSIONS	The results of this follow-up study will have importance for all pregnant women and for health professionals who provide care for pregnant women . CONCLUSIONS	Although the results will have been collected in seven countries with limited health care resources ( Argentina , Chile , Ghana , India , Kenya , Pakistan , Sudan ) any differences in outcomes associated with different surgical techniques are likely to be generalisable throughout the world .

"OBJECTIVE	Nausea and vomiting ( NV ) related to DMSO affect patients undergoing auto-SCT despite antiemetic measures . OBJECTIVE	Orange flavoring may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms . METHODS	A multicenter , randomized , three-arm , open-label trial in four Italian large bone marrow transplant centers was conducted to assess the effectiveness of orange aroma in preventing NV related to DMSO . METHODS	Patients were randomized to orange ice lollies , non-citrus ice lollies , and routine treatment ( deep breaths ) during reinfusion . METHODS	Data on NV were collected up to 5days after infusion ; 69/98 patients were randomized : 23 to orange , 21 to non-citrus ice lollies , and 25 to routine treatment . RESULTS	Although 48h after transplantation no differences were observed in controlled nausea ( Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) 0-100 , 25 ) or vomiting , significantly fewer patients had no episodes of vomiting , no antiemetic rescue therapy , and no nausea ( NRS < 5 ) in the deep breath vs lollies groups ( P = 0.017 ) . RESULTS	The intensity of nausea over time differed significantly between ice lollies vs routine care ( P = 0.001 ) groups , but not between the orange and non-citrus groups ( P = 0.428 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The vasoconstrictive action of ice may prevent NV related to DMSO in the acute phase and reduce the need for rescue antiemetic therapy . CONCLUSIONS	Ice lollies offer a simple , noninvasive , and economic means for relieving nausea and vomiting related to this preservative ."
"OBJECTIVE	The pharmacokinetics of nifedipine as a tocolytic agent has not been studied in great detail in pregnant women and has instead focused on immediate release tablets and gastrointestinal therapeutic system ( GITS ) tablets . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine nifedipine slow-release half-life and distribution volume in pregnant women and to compare these with pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine in non-pregnant subjects described in the literature . METHODS	This is a study parallel to a trial studying women with threatened preterm labor between 26 + 0 and 32 + 2 weeks after initial tocolysis and a completed course of corticosteroids , who were randomly allocated to maintenance nifedipine ( slow-release tablets 20 mg 4 times daily ) or placebo . METHODS	Exclusion criteria for the pharmacokinetic study were contra-indications for nifedipine , impaired liver function , and concomitant intake of inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme . METHODS	Blood samples for measuring nifedipine plasma concentrations were drawn at t = 0 , t = 12 hours , t = 24 hours , t = 48 hours , t = 72 hours , t = 7 days , and t = 9 days . METHODS	Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using iterative two-stage Bayesian population pharmacokinetic analysis by MWPharm software . METHODS	The study was designed to establish a correlation between body weight and nifedipine plasma level . RESULTS	The pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine slow-release tablets were determined from the data of 8 pregnant women . RESULTS	Nifedipine slow-release had a half-life of 2 - 5 hours , a mean distribution volume of 6.2 1.9 L/kg ( calculated while using a fixed biological availability of 0.45 taken from the literature due to lack of intravenous data in this population ) compared to a half-life of 6 - 11 hours , and a distribution volume of 1.2 - 1.3 L/kg described in non-pregnant subjects in the literature . RESULTS	None of the women delivered during study medication . RESULTS	Study medication was continued for the duration of the pharmacokinetic study ( 9 days ) in all women . RESULTS	A correlation between nifedipine plasma levels and maternal body weight was not demonstrated . RESULTS	This may have been caused by lack of power . CONCLUSIONS	Pregnant subjects in this study , using nifedipine slow-release tablets , showed a larger volume of distribution and a shorter elimination half-life than for non-pregnant subjects as published in the literature ."
"BACKGROUND	Impairment of the mucosal barrier plays an important role in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis . BACKGROUND	The myosin IXB ( MYO9B ) gene and the two tight-junction adaptor genes , PARD3 and MAGI2 , have been linked to gastrointestinal permeability . BACKGROUND	Common variants of these genes are associated with celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease , two other conditions in which intestinal permeability plays a role . BACKGROUND	We investigated genetic variation in MYO9B , PARD3 and MAGI2 for association with acute pancreatitis . METHODS	Five single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in MYO9B , two SNPs in PARD3 , and three SNPs in MAGI2 were studied in a Dutch cohort of 387 patients with acute pancreatitis and over 800 controls , and in a German cohort of 235 patients and 250 controls . RESULTS	Association to MYO9B and PARD3 was observed in the Dutch cohort , but only one SNP in MYO9B and one in MAGI2 showed association in the German cohort ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Joint analysis of the combined cohorts showed that , after correcting for multiple testing , only two SNPs in MYO9B remained associated ( rs7259292 , p = 0.0031 , odds ratio ( OR ) 1.94 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 1.35-2 .78 ; rs1545620 , p = 0.0006 , OR 1.33 , 95 % CI 1.16-1 .53 ) . RESULTS	SNP rs1545620 is a non-synonymous SNP previously suspected to impact on ulcerative colitis . RESULTS	None of the SNPs showed association to disease severity or etiology . CONCLUSIONS	Variants in MYO9B may be involved in acute pancreatitis , but we found no evidence for involvement of PARD3 or MAGI2 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and discuss its action mechanism . METHODS	Fifty-seven cases were randomly divided into two groups . METHODS	The acupuncture group ( 29 cases ) was treated with acupuncture at Taichong ( LR 3 ) , Zusanli ( ST 36 ) and Sanyinjiao ( SP 6 ) etc. , once a day and 5 times per week . METHODS	The medication group ( 28 cases ) was treated with oral administration of pinaverium ( 50 mg each time , 3 times a day ) and live combined bifidobacterium and lactobacillus tablet ( 4 tablets each time , 3 times a day ) . METHODS	Four weeks were taken as a treatment course in both groups . METHODS	Before and after treatment ELISA method was applied to measure the level of serum 5-HT of the patients in two groups . METHODS	The scores of clinical symptoms were observed before treatment , after one and four weeks of treatment and 3 months after treatment , respectively . RESULTS	The level of serum 5-HT was significantly reduced in the acupuncture group and medication group ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) , which had no statistical difference between two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .

CONCLUSIONS	The acupuncture treatment could reduce the visceral sensitivity , improve the intestinal motility and regulate the imbalance of brain-intestine interactive function ."
"BACKGROUND	Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) with poor response to standard antimicrobial therapy is a growing medical concern . BACKGROUND	We aimed to investigate the outcomes of fecal microbiota transplant ( FMT ) for relapsing CDI using a frozen suspension from unrelated donors , comparing colonoscopic and nasogastric tube ( NGT ) administration . METHODS	Healthy volunteer donors were screened and a frozen fecal suspension was generated . METHODS	Patients with relapsing/refractory CDI were randomized to receive an infusion of donor stools by colonoscopy or NGT . METHODS	The primary endpoint was clinical resolution of diarrhea without relapse after 8 weeks . METHODS	The secondary endpoint was self-reported health score using standardized questionnaires . RESULTS	A total of 20 patients were enrolled , 10 in each treatment arm . RESULTS	Patients had a median of 4 ( range , 2-16 ) relapses prior to study enrollment , with 5 ( range , 3-15 ) antibiotic treatment failures . RESULTS	Resolution of diarrhea was achieved in 14 patients ( 70 % ) after a single FMT ( 8 of 10 in the colonoscopy group and 6 of 10 in the NGT group ) . RESULTS	Five patients were retreated , with 4 obtaining cure , resulting in an overall cure rate of 90 % . RESULTS	Daily number of bowel movements changed from a median of 7 ( interquartile range [ IQR ] , 5-10 ) the day prior to FMT to 2 ( IQR , 1-2 ) after the infusion . RESULTS	Self-ranked health score improved significantly , from a median of 4 ( IQR , 2-6 ) before transplant to 8 ( IQR , 5-9 ) after transplant . RESULTS	No serious or unexpected adverse events occurred . CONCLUSIONS	In our initial feasibility study , FMT using a frozen inoculum from unrelated donors is effective in treating relapsing CDI . CONCLUSIONS	NGT administration appears to be as effective as colonoscopic administration . BACKGROUND	NCT01704937 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To observe the effect of catgut implantation at acupoint on the content of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , and to explore its mechanism for treatment of ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) . METHODS	Seventy-four AS patients were randomly assigned to the observation group and the control group by digit random table , 37 in each group . METHODS	Patients in the control group took Sulfasalazine Enteric-coated Tablet ( SECT ) , 0.5 g each time , three times daily for 3 months . METHODS	Those in the observation group additionally received catgut implantation at acupoint for 3 months . METHODS	Changes of visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , Schober test , pillow wall distance , thoracic activity , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , and TNF-alpha were compared after 3 months of treatment . RESULTS	There was obvious change in VAS , Schober test , pillow wall distance , thoracic activity , ESR , CRP , and TNF-alpha after treatment in the both groups , showing statistical difference when compared with before treatment ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	The aforesaid indices were obviously improved after treatment in the observation group ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Catgut implantation at acupoint , as an assistant therapy , could significantly improve clinical symptoms and signs , decrease the level of TNF-alpha , and its effect was superior to that of oral SECT administration alone ."
"BACKGROUND	Transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) without sedation has been reported to be safe and tolerable . BACKGROUND	It has recently been used widely in Japan for the detection of upper gastrointestinal disease . BACKGROUND	Alternatively , transoral examination using a thin endoscope has also been reported to be highly tolerable . OBJECTIVE	To examine the cardiocirculatory effects of transoral versus transnasal EGD in an attempt to determine the most suitable endoscopic methods for patients 75 years of age . METHODS	Subjects who underwent monitoring of respiratory and circulatory dynamics without sedation during endoscopic screening examinations were enrolled at the New Ooe Hospital ( Kyoto , Japan ) between April 2008 and March 2009 . METHODS	A total of 165 patients ( age 75 years ) provided written informed consent and were investigated in the present study . METHODS	Patients were randomly divided into three subgroups : UO group -- thin endoscope ; SO group -- standard endoscope ; and UT group -- transnasal EGD . METHODS	Percutaneous arterial blood oxygen saturation , heart rate and blood pressure were evaluated just before EGD and at five time points during EGD . METHODS	After transnasal EGD , patients who had previously been examined using transoral EGD with a standard endoscope were asked about preferences for their next examination . RESULTS	There were no statistical differences in the characteristics among the groups . RESULTS	Percutaneous oxygen saturation in the UT group showed a transient drop compared with the SO and UO groups at the beginning of the endoscopic procedure . RESULTS	Heart rate showed no significant differences among the SO , UO and UT groups ; Systolic blood pressure in the UO group was lower immediately after insertion compared with the SO and UT groups . RESULTS	The rate pressure product in the UO group was comparable with that in the UT group during endoscopy , and the SO group showed a continuously higher level than the UO and UT groups . RESULTS	More than one-half ( 54.4 % ) of patients were ` willing to choose transnasal EGD for next examination ' . CONCLUSIONS	For elderly patients , unsedated transnasal EGD failed to show an advantage over unsedated standard endoscopy . CONCLUSIONS	Transoral thin EGD was estimated to be safe and tolerable ."
"BACKGROUND	Infectious complications and especially anastomotic leakage ( AL ) severely impede the recuperation of patients following colorectal cancer ( CRC ) surgery . BACKGROUND	When the normal gut barrier fails , as in AL , pathogenic microorganisms can enter the circulation and may cause severe sepsis which is associated with substantial mortality . BACKGROUND	Moreover , AL has a negative impact on the CRC prognosis . BACKGROUND	Selective decontamination of the digestive tract ( SDD ) employs oral nonabsorbable antibiotics to eradicate pathogenic microorganisms before elective tumour resection . METHODS	In this multicentre randomised clinical trial , perioperative SDD in addition to standard antibiotic prophylaxis is compared with standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone in patients with CRC who undergo elective surgical resection with a curative intent . METHODS	The SDD regimen consists of colistin , tobramycin and amphotericin B. METHODS	The primary objectives of this randomised clinical trial are to evaluate if perioperative SDD reduces the incidence of clinical AL and its septic consequences as well as other infectious complications . METHODS	A main secondary objective is improvement of the cancer-free survival . METHODS	A total of 762 patients will be included in total for sufficient power . CONCLUSIONS	It is hypothesised that SDD will reduce clinical AL thereby reducing the morbidity and the mortality in CRC patients . BACKGROUND	The trial is investigator-initiated , investigator-driven and supported by the Dutch Digestive Foundation ( WO 11-06 ) and the private Posthumus Meyes Fund . BACKGROUND	The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT01740947 ."
"BACKGROUND	The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing worldwide and an effective and safe pharmacological treatment is needed . BACKGROUND	We investigated whether inhibition of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11-HSD1 , also known as HSD11B1 ) by RO5093151 could safely and effectively decrease liver-fat content in patients with this disorder . METHODS	We did this phase 1b trial at four centres in Germany and Austria . METHODS	Participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( defined as ( 1 ) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy liver-fat content > 556 % ) , insulin resistance ( homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [ HOMA-IR ] of at least 20 mmol/LmU/L ) , BMI greater than 27 kg/m ( 2 ) , and aged 35-65 years were randomly assigned by interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio , stratified for triglyceride concentration ( < 17 mmol/L or 17 mmol/L ) , to oral RO5093151 ( 200 mg twice daily ) or matching placebo for 12 weeks . METHODS	The main exclusion criteria were other liver diseases , aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase concentrations of more than two and a half times the upper limit of normal , history of diabetes or bariatric surgery , and use of weight lowering drugs . METHODS	Participants and investigators were masked to assignment throughout the study . METHODS	The primary endpoint was change in liver-fat content from baseline to week 12 . METHODS	Efficacy analysis was by modified intention to treat , including all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline and follow-up measurement of liver-fat content . METHODS	Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug . METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01277094 . RESULTS	We did this trial between Jan 13 , 2011 , and March 28 , 2012.41 patients were randomly assigned to RO5093151 and 41 to placebo . RESULTS	35 patients in the RO5093151 group and 39 in the placebo group were included in the efficacy analysis . RESULTS	Mean liver-fat content decreased in the RO5093151 group ( from 1675 % [ SD 867 ] to 1428 % [ 889 ] ) , but not in the placebo group ( from 1853 % [ 1000 ] to 1846 % [ 1078 ] , p = 002 for between group difference ) . RESULTS	26 participants ( 65 % ) in the RO5093151 group had adverse events , compared with 21 ( 53 % ) in the placebo group . RESULTS	The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders ( 12 patients [ 30 % ] in the RO5093151 group vs seven [ 18 % ] in the placebo group ) , and infections and infestations ( eight [ 20 % ] vs nine [ 23 % ] ) . RESULTS	Nervous system disorders occurred in significantly more patients in the RO5093151 group than in the placebo group ( nine [ 23 % ] vs two [ 5 % ] ; p = 002 ) ; all other differences in adverse events were non-significant . RESULTS	One participant ( 3 % ) in the placebo group and three participants ( 8 % ) in the RO5093151 group had serious adverse events . RESULTS	All serious adverse events were deemed unrelated to study treatment . CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of 11-HSD1 by RO5093151 was effective and safe in reducing liver-fat content , suggesting that targeting of 11-HSD1 might be a promising approach for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .

"BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of working length determination methods , electronic apex locator and digital radiography , on postoperative pain . METHODS	Two hundred twenty patients with asymptomatic single-rooted vital teeth were randomly assigned to 2 groups according to the method used for working length determination , the radiographic group and the electronic apex locator group . METHODS	After working length determination , chemomechanical preparation was performed in a crown-down technique with ProTaper instruments . METHODS	A master cone radiograph was taken . METHODS	Canals were obturated with gutta-percha and sealer by using a lateral compaction technique . METHODS	Postoperative pain was assessed after 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , and 48hours by using a 4-point pain intensity scale . METHODS	In addition , patients were asked to record the number of days necessary to achieve complete pain resolution . RESULTS	Postoperative pain during the 4-hour to 48-hour interval studied was not significantly different ( P > .05 ) between groups . RESULTS	The mean times for pain dissipation in the radiographic and electronic apex locator groups were 3.37 2.79 and 3.88 3.34 days , respectively . RESULTS	The difference between groups was not statistically significant ( P > .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	There is no difference in postoperative pain between working length measurement methods by using an electronic apex locator or digital radiography . CONCLUSIONS	The reduced exposure to radiation by using apex locator may be a factor that influences a dentist 's decision to choose the electronic apex locator over radiography ."
"BACKGROUND	Dietary carbohydrates may affect metabolic and physiologic parameters . BACKGROUND	The present study evaluated whether a combination of two dietary fibers , oligofructose ( OFS ) and pectin ( P ) , altered satiety and glycemic parameters . BACKGROUND	The primary objective of this study was to determine whether dietary supplementation for 3weeks with OFS+P would produce a greater reduction in energy intake of an ad libitum test meal compared to control . METHODS	This was a single center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study in overweight and obese , otherwise healthy , subjects ( N = 96 ) . METHODS	There were two OFS+P treatment groups : high-dose ( 30g/d ) , low-dose ( 15g/d ) , and a control group ( maltodextrin 15g/d ) . METHODS	Energy intake , appetite measures based on Satiety Labeled Intensity Magnitude ( SLIM ) scale , fasting and post-prandial glucose , and insulin levels and body weight were measured at baseline and at the end of 3weeks . METHODS	Adverse events and gastrointestinal tolerability of the treatments were also assessed . RESULTS	An analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) performed on the primary endpoint change from baseline in energy intake , showed no statistically significant difference in energy intake among the three treatment groups ( p = 0.5387 ) . RESULTS	The LS mean changes ( SE ) in energy intake from baseline to week 3 were -58.3 ( 42.4 ) kilocalories ( kcal ) for the high dose group , -74.2 ( 43.6 ) kcal for the low dose group , and -9.0 ( 42.9 ) kcal for the control group . RESULTS	For the pairwise comparisons of OFS+P doses and control , confidence intervals were constructed around the difference in LS mean changes . RESULTS	All study products were generally well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	There was a directional benefit in ad libitum energy intake for both OFS+P doses compared to control , with a greater reduction in kilocalories in the low dose comparison , but the reductions were not significant . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted . BACKGROUND	GSK Clinical Study Register # W7781293 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To determine the efficacy and safety of Curcuma domestica extracts in pain reduction and functional improvement . METHODS	367 primary knee osteoarthritis patients with a pain score of 5 or higher were randomized to receive ibuprofen 1,200 mg/day or C. domestica extracts 1,500 mg/day for 4 weeks . METHODS	The main outcomes were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) total , WOMAC pain , WOMAC stiffness , and WOMAC function scores . METHODS	Adverse events ( AEs ) were also recorded . RESULTS	185 and 182 patients were randomly assigned into C. domestica extracts and ibuprofen groups , respectively . RESULTS	The baseline characteristics were no different between groups . RESULTS	The mean of all WOMAC scores at weeks 0 , 2 , and 4 showed significant improvement when compared with the baseline in both groups . RESULTS	After using the noninferiority test , the mean difference ( 95 % confidence interval ) of WOMAC total , WOMAC pain , and WOMAC function scores at week 4 adjusted by values at week 0 of C. domestica extracts were noninferior to those for the ibuprofen group ( P = 0.010 , P = 0.018 , and P = 0.010 , respectively ) , except for the WOMAC stiffness subscale , which showed a trend toward significance ( P = 0.060 ) . RESULTS	The number of patients who developed AEs was no different between groups . RESULTS	However , the number of events of abdominal pain/discomfort was significantly higher in the ibuprofen group than that in the C. domestica extracts group ( P = 0.046 ) . RESULTS	Most subjects ( 96 % -97 % ) were satisfied with the treatment , and two-thirds rated themselves as improved in a global assessment . CONCLUSIONS	C. domestica extracts are as effective as ibuprofen for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis . CONCLUSIONS	The side effect profile was similar but with fewer gastrointestinal AE reports in the C. domestica extracts group ."
"BACKGROUND	Identification of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease in the intestinal tract by PET/computed tomography ( CT ) imaging can be hampered by physiological uptake of F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG ) in the normal colon . BACKGROUND	Previous work has localized this F-FDG uptake to the intestinal lumen , predominantly occupied by bacteria . BACKGROUND	We sought to determine whether pretreatment with an antibiotic could reduce F-FDG uptake in the healthy colon . METHODS	Thirty patients undergoing restaging PET/CT for nongastrointestinal lymphoma were randomly selected to receive rifaximin 550 mg twice daily for 2 days before their scan ( post-rifaximin ) . METHODS	Their PET/CT images were compared with those from their prior study ( pre-rifaximin ) . METHODS	Cecal maximum standard uptake value ( SUVmax ) and overall colonic F-FDG uptake were compared between scans . METHODS	All PET/CT images were blindly scored by a radiologist . METHODS	The same comparison of sequential scans was also undertaken in 30 patients who did not receive antibiotics . RESULTS	Thirty post-rifaximin scans were compared with 30 pre-rifaximin scans in the same patients . RESULTS	SUVmax in the cecum was significantly lower in the patient 's post-rifaximin scans than in their pre-rifaximin scans ( P = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	The percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake was significantly lower in the post-rifaximin scans than in the pre-rifaximin scans ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	In contrast , there was no significant difference in the paired sequential scans from control patients , nor a reduction in the percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake . CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study shows that treatment with rifaximin for 2 days before PET/CT scanning can significantly reduce physiological F-FDG uptake in the normal colonic lumen ."
"OBJECTIVE	For advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) patients who are responding to imatinib mesylate , the role of surgery has not been formally demonstrated . OBJECTIVE	This multicenter randomised controlled trial was designed to assess whether surgery to treat residual disease for patients with recurrent/metastatic GISTs responding to imatinib mesylate ( IM ) improved progression free survival ( PFS ) compared with IM treatment alone . METHODS	Between 3 and 12months after starting IM for recurrent/metastatic GISTs , eligible patients were randomised to two arms : Arm A ( surgery for residual disease ) and Arm B ( IM treatment alone ) . METHODS	In Arm A ( 19pts ) , surgery was performed to remove residual macroscopic lesions as completely as possible , and IM treatment continued after surgery . METHODS	In Arm B ( 22pts ) , IM was given alone at a dose of 400mg per day until disease progression . METHODS	The primary end-point was PFS measured from the date IM started . METHODS	This study was registered in the ChiCTR registry with the ID number ChiCTR-TRC-00000244 . RESULTS	This randomised trial was closed early due to poor accrual . RESULTS	Only 41 patients were enrolled as opposed to 210 patients planned . RESULTS	2-year PFS was 88.4 % in the surgery arm and 57.7 % in the IM-alone arm ( P = 0.089 ) . RESULTS	Median overall survival ( mOS ) was not reached in the surgery arm and 49months in patients with IM-alone arm ( P = 0.024 ) . CONCLUSIONS	While no significant differences were observed in the two arms , this study suggests that surgical removal of the metastatic lesion may improve the outcome of advanced GIST patients and should stimulate additional research on this topic ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the benefit of aerobic exercise on colonic transit time ( CTT ) for psychiatric inpatients in a closed ward . METHODS	Sixty consecutive adult inpatients of the Somang Hospital Psychiatry Unit ( Eumsung-gun , South Korea ) , without CTT-related diseases or drug therapies , were recruited for study from March to June of 2012 . METHODS	Upon enrollment , the patients were randomly assigned to partake in a 12-wk instructor-led group aerobic exercise program ( exercise group ; n = 30 ) or to maintain their ordinary daily activities ( control group ; n = 30 ) . METHODS	The exercise program was structured as 10 min warm-up ( stretching ) , 40 min exercise , and 10 min cool-down ( stretching ) for three days each week . METHODS	The exercise sessions consisted of walking only in week one and aerobics from weeks two to 12 , with increasing intensity ( 50 % heart rate reserve ( HRR ) for weeks one to four , 60 % HRR for weeks five to eight , and 70 % HRR for weeks nine to 12 ) . METHODS	CTT was measured before ( baseline ) and after ( week 12 ) the exercise program , in duplicate ( on days four and seven ) , using abdominal radiography and the multiple radio-opaque marker technique . METHODS	Changes in the exercising patients ' CTT and weight - , cardiovascular - and fitness-related parameters were statistically assessed . RESULTS	The study dropout rate was 30.0 % , with 23 patients in the exercise group and 19 patients in the control group completing the study . RESULTS	At week 12 , the exercise group showed decreases in body weight ( mean SE ) baseline : 69.4 2.8 vs study-end : 67.6 2.7 ; P < 0.635 ) and body mass index ( BMI ) ( 25.2 1.1 vs 24.9 0.8 ; P < 0.810 ) , but the extent of change was not significantly different from that experienced by the control group ( body weight : 68.8 4.0 vs 68.8 3.9 ; BMI : 24.3 1.1 vs 24.4 1.2 ) . RESULTS	However , the exercise group showed significant improvements in leg muscle strength ( baseline : 41.7 4.3 vs study-end : 64.1 5.0 ; P < 0.001 ) , cardio-respiratory endurance ( 120.5 4.5 vs 105.4 2.8 ; P < 0.004 ) , and leg muscle elasticity and power output ( 21.5 2.6 vs 30.6 2.8 ; P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The exercise group showed an exercise-induced reduction in total CTT ( baseline : 54.2 8.0 vs 30.3 6.1 ) , which was significantly different from that experienced by the control group over the 12-wk period ( 48.6 9.3 vs 48.3 12.3 ; P = 0.027 ) ; however , the exercise-induced decreases in CTT involving the three colonic segments examined ( right , left and recto-sigmoid ) showed no significant differences from the control group . CONCLUSIONS	A 12-wk aerobic exercise program can benefit psychiatric inpatients by increasing intestinal motility , possibly decreasing risk of metabolic - and cardiovascular-related disease ."
"OBJECTIVE	Anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches are considered for the management of type 2 diabetes and for the prevention of its complications . OBJECTIVE	There is limited evidence regarding the effects of prebiotics on inflammation , especially in patients with type 2 diabetes . OBJECTIVE	This trial aims to examine the effects of oligofructose-enriched inulin on glycemic status , inflammation markers , and metabolic endotoxemia in female patients . METHODS	Over a period of 8 wk , 52 women with body mass indices of > 25 kg/m ( 2 ) but < 35 kg/m ( 2 ) with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either an intervention group , in which participants were given oligofructose-enriched inulin ( n = 27 , consuming 10 g/d of oligofructose-enriched inulin ) , or to a control group , in which participants were given maltodextrin ( n = 25 , consuming 10 g/d of maltodextrin ) . METHODS	Fasting plasma glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor - , interferon - , interleukin-10 , and plasma lipopolysaccharide were measured before and after the intervention . METHODS	Data were analyzed with the use of SPSS software version 13 . METHODS	Paired and unpaired Student t tests and analysis of covariance were used to compare quantitative variables . RESULTS	Oligofructose-enriched inulin caused a significant decrease in the levels of fasting plasma glucose ( 19.2 mg/dL ; 9.50 % ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( 1.0 % ; 8.40 % ) , interleukin-6 ( 1.3 pg/mL ; 8.15 % ) , tumor necrosis factor - ( 3.0 pg/mL ; 19.80 % ) and plasma lipopolysaccharide ( 6.0 EU/mL ; 21.95 % ) as compared with maltodextrin ( P < 0.05 ) .

CONCLUSIONS	No adverse effects of probiotics supplementation were observed ."
"OBJECTIVE	Gluten ingestion leads to small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease , necessitating strict life-long exclusion of dietary gluten . OBJECTIVE	Despite adherence to a gluten-free diet , many patients remain symptomatic and still have small intestinal inflammation . OBJECTIVE	In this case , nondietary therapies are needed . OBJECTIVE	We investigated the ability of ALV003 , a mixture of 2 recombinant gluten-specific proteases given orally , to protect patients with celiac disease from gluten-induced mucosal injury in a phase 2 trial . METHODS	We established the optimal daily dose of gluten to be used in a 6-week challenge study . METHODS	Then , in the intervention study , adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease were randomly assigned to groups given ALV003 ( n = 20 ) or placebo ( n = 21 ) together with the daily gluten challenge . METHODS	Duodenal biopsies were collected at baseline and after gluten challenge . METHODS	The ratio of villus height to crypt depth and densities of intraepithelial lymphocytes were the primary end points . RESULTS	A daily dose of 2 g gluten was selected for the intervention study . RESULTS	Sixteen patients given ALV003 and 18 given placebo were eligible for efficacy evaluation . RESULTS	Biopsies from subjects in the placebo group showed evidence of mucosal injury after gluten challenge ( mean villus height to crypt depth ratio changed from 2.8 before challenge to 2.0 afterward ; P = .0007 ; density of CD3 ( + ) intraepithelial lymphocytes changed from 61 to 91 cells/mm after challenge ; P = .0003 ) . RESULTS	However , no significant mucosal deterioration was observed in biopsies from the ALV003 group . RESULTS	Between groups , morphologic changes and CD3 ( + ) intraepithelial lymphocyte counts differed significantly from baseline to week 6 ( P = .0133 and P = .0123 , respectively ) . RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between groups . CONCLUSIONS	Based on a phase 2 trial , the glutenase ALV003 appears to attenuate gluten-induced small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease in the context of an everyday gluten-free diet containing daily up to 2 g gluten . CONCLUSIONS	Clinicaltrial.gov , METHODS	NCT00959114 and NCT01255696 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To identify the effects of ingested anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin on enteric expressions of SIgA in pediatric rotavirus enteritis . METHODS	In this randomized , placebo controlled clinic trial , 100 patients of pediatric rotavirus enteritis who simultaneously received fluid replacement as basic therapy , were randomly divided into control and immunoglobulin treated groups . METHODS	The patients in experimental group were given `` ingested antirotavirus IgY '' . METHODS	Stool sample was collected at day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 , the level of fecal SIgA was quantifies by radioimmunoassay kit , and fecal rotavirus shedding was detected by double-sandwich ELISA . RESULTS	The frequency of diarrhea in immunoglobulin group was obviously less than that in control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The mean course of diarrhea was ( 4.5 + / - 0.92 ) d in immunoglobulin group , and ( 5.8 + / - 1.68 ) d in control group ( P = 0.015 ) . RESULTS	The fecal SIgA level in immunoglobulin group was higher than that in control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The doubling time of SIgA level was the 3rd d in immunoglobulin group , and the 5th d in control group . RESULTS	The fecal rotavirus shedding in immunoglobulin group was obviously lower than that in control group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Ingested anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin could promote the expression of enteric SIgA to remove rotavirus , achieving the benefit to release diarrhea in pediatric rotavirus enteritis ."
"BACKGROUND	Fibre intake among North Americans is currently less than half the recommended amount . BACKGROUND	Consumers are interested in food products that could promote weight loss and improve health . BACKGROUND	Consequently , evaluation of unique fibre sources with potential gut-mediated benefits for metabolic health warrants investigation . BACKGROUND	Our objective is to assess the effects of yellow pea fibre supplementation on weight loss and gut microbiota in an overweight and obese adult population . METHODS	In a double blind , placebo controlled , parallel group study , overweight and obese ( BMI = 25-38 ) adults will be randomized to either a 15 g/d yellow pea fibre supplemented group or isocaloric placebo group for 12 weeks ( n = 30/group ) . METHODS	The primary outcome measure is a change in body fat from baseline to 12 weeks . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include glucose tolerance , appetite regulation , serum lipids and inflammatory markers . METHODS	Anthropometric data ( height , weight , BMI , and waist circumference ) and food intake ( by 3-day weighed food records ) will be measured at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter . METHODS	Subjective ratings of appetite will be recorded by participants at home on a weekly basis using validated visual analogue scales . METHODS	At week 0 and at the end of the study ( week 12 ) , an ad libitum lunch buffet protocol for objective food intake measures and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan for body composition will be completed . METHODS	Participants will be instructed not to change their exercise habits during the 12 week study . METHODS	Glucose and insulin will be measured during an oral glucose tolerance test at weeks 0 and 12 .

"OBJECTIVE	At present , there is debate about the gastrointestinal effects of A1-type beta-casein protein in cows ' milk compared with the progenitor A2 type . OBJECTIVE	In vitro and animal studies suggest that digestion of A1 but not A2 beta-casein affects gastrointestinal motility and inflammation through the release of beta-casomorphin-7 . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to evaluate differences in gastrointestinal effects in a human adult population between milk containing A1 versus A2 beta-casein . METHODS	Forty-one females and males were recruited into this double-blinded , randomised 8-week cross-over study . METHODS	Participants underwent a 2-week dairy washout ( rice milk replaced dairy ) , followed by 2 weeks of milk ( 750ml/day ) that contained beta-casein of either A1 or A2 type before undergoing a second washout followed by a final 2 weeks of the alternative A1 or A2 type milk . RESULTS	The A1 beta-casein milk led to significantly higher stool consistency values ( Bristol Stool Scale ) compared with the A2 beta-casein milk . RESULTS	There was also a significant positive association between abdominal pain and stool consistency on the A1 diet ( r = 0.520 , P = 0.001 ) , but not the A2 diet ( r = -0.13 , P = 0.43 ) . RESULTS	The difference between these two correlations ( 0.52 versus -0.13 ) was highly significant ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Furthermore , some individuals may be susceptible to A1 beta-casein , as evidenced by higher faecal calprotectin values and associated intolerance measures . CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary results suggest differences in gastrointestinal responses in some adult humans consuming milk containing beta-casein of either the A1 or the A2 beta-casein type , but require confirmation in a larger study of participants with perceived intolerance to ordinary A1 beta-casein-containing milk ."
"OBJECTIVE	A low FODMAP ( Fermentable Oligosaccharides , Disaccharides , Monosaccharides And Polyols ) diet reduces symptoms of IBS , but reduction of potential prebiotic and fermentative effects might adversely affect the colonic microenvironment . OBJECTIVE	The effects of a low FODMAP diet with a typical Australian diet on biomarkers of colonic health were compared in a single-blinded , randomised , cross-over trial . METHODS	Twenty-seven IBS and six healthy subjects were randomly allocated one of two 21-day provided diets , differing only in FODMAP content ( mean ( 95 % CI ) low 3.05 ( 1.86 to 4.25 ) g/day vs Australian 23.7 ( 16.9 to 30.6 ) g/day ) , and then crossed over to the other diet with 21-day washout period . METHODS	Faeces passed over a 5-day run-in on their habitual diet and from day 17 to day 21 of the interventional diets were pooled , and pH , short-chain fatty acid concentrations and bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed . RESULTS	Faecal indices were similar in IBS and healthy subjects during habitual diets . RESULTS	The low FODMAP diet was associated with higher faecal pH ( 7.37 ( 7.23 to 7.51 ) vs. 7.16 ( 7.02 to 7.30 ) ; p = 0.001 ) , similar short-chain fatty acid concentrations , greater microbial diversity and reduced total bacterial abundance ( 9.63 ( 9.53 to 9.73 ) vs. 9.83 ( 9.72 to 9.93 ) log10 copies/g ; p < 0.001 ) compared with the Australian diet . RESULTS	To indicate direction of change , in comparison with the habitual diet the low FODMAP diet reduced total bacterial abundance and the typical Australian diet increased relative abundance for butyrate-producing Clostridium cluster XIVa ( median ratio 6.62 ; p < 0.001 ) and mucus-associated Akkermansia muciniphila ( 19.3 ; p < 0.001 ) , and reduced Ruminococcus torques . CONCLUSIONS	Diets differing in FODMAP content have marked effects on gut microbiota composition . CONCLUSIONS	The implications of long-term reduction of intake of FODMAPs require elucidation .

"OBJECTIVE	We aimed to assess changes in myositis core set measures and ancillary clinical and laboratory data from the National Institutes of Health 's subset of patients enrolled in the Rituximab in Myositis trial . METHODS	Eighteen patients ( 5 dermatomyositis , 8 polymyositis , 5 juvenile dermatomyositis ) completed more in-depth testing of muscle strength and cutaneous assessments , patient-reported outcomes , and laboratory tests before and after administration of rituximab . METHODS	Percentage change in individual measures and in the definitions of improvement ( DOIs ) and standardized response means were examined over 44 weeks . RESULTS	Core set activity measures improved by 18-70 % from weeks 0-44 and were sensitive to change . RESULTS	Fifteen patients met the DOI at week 44 , 9 patients met a DOI 50 % response , and 4 met a DOI 70 % response . RESULTS	Muscle strength and function measures were more sensitive to change than cutaneous assessments . RESULTS	Constitutional , gastrointestinal , and pulmonary systems improved 44-70 % . RESULTS	Patient-reported outcomes improved up to 28 % . RESULTS	CD20 + B cells were depleted in the periphery , but B cell depletion was not associated with clinical improvement at week 16 . CONCLUSIONS	This subset of patients had high rates of clinical response to rituximab , similar to patients in the overall trial . CONCLUSIONS	Most measures were responsive , and muscle strength had a greater degree of change than cutaneous assessments . CONCLUSIONS	Several novel assessment tools , including measures of strength and function , extra-muscular organ activity , fatigue , and health-related quality of life , are promising for use in future myositis trials . CONCLUSIONS	Further study of B cell-depleting therapies in myositis , particularly in treatment-nave patients , is warranted ."
"BACKGROUND	Idiopathic bile acid malabsorption ( BAM ) has been suggested as a cause of chronic watery diarrhoea , with a response to colestyramine in 70 % of patients . BACKGROUND	However , the efficacy of this drug has never been investigated in placebo-controlled trials . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of colestyramine as compared with hydroxypropyl cellulose in the treatment of functional chronic watery diarrhoea . METHODS	Patients with chronic watery diarrhoea were randomly assigned to groups given colestyramine sachets 4g twice daily ( n = 13 ) or identical hydroxypropyl cellulose sachets ( n = 13 ) for 8weeks . METHODS	The primary end-point was clinical remission defined as a mean of 3 or fewer stools per day during the week before the visit , with less than 1 watery stool per day . METHODS	A secondary end-point was the reduction in daily watery stool number . METHODS	SeHCAT test was performed in all patients , but an abnormal test was not a prerequisite to be included . RESULTS	All included patients had a SeHCAT 7-day retention 20 % . RESULTS	There were no statistical differences in the percentage of patients in clinical remission at week 8 between colestyramine and hydroxypropyl cellulose with either intention-to-treat ( 53.8 % vs. 38.4 % ; P = 0.43 ) or per-protocol ( 63.6 % vs. 38.4 % ; P = 0.22 ) analyses . RESULTS	However , the mean per cent decrease in watery stool number was significantly higher with colestyramine than with hydroxypropyl cellulose ( -92.43.5 % vs. -75.87.1 % ; P = 0.048 ) . RESULTS	The rate of adverse events related to study drugs did not differ between groups . CONCLUSIONS	Colestyramine ( 4g twice daily ) is effective and safe for short-term treatment of patients with chronic watery diarrhoea presumably secondary to BAM . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical Trials Register number EudraCT 2009-011149-14 ."
"BACKGROUND	Wholegrain rye has been associated with decreased hunger sensations . BACKGROUND	This may be partly mediated by colonic fermentation . BACKGROUND	Sustained consumption of fermentable components is known to change the gut microflora and may increase numbers of saccharolytic bacteria . OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of wholegrain rye consumption on appetite and colonic fermentation after a subsequent meal . METHODS	In a randomized , controlled , three-arm cross-over study , twelve healthy male subjects consumed three iso-caloric evening test meals . METHODS	The test meals were based on white wheat bread ( WBB ) , wholegrain rye kernel bread ( RKB ) , or boiled rye kernels ( RK ) . METHODS	Breath hydrogen excretion and subjective appetite sensation were measured before and at 30min intervals for 3h after a standardized breakfast in the subsequent morning . METHODS	After the 3h , an ad libitum lunch meal was served to assess energy intake . METHODS	In an in vitro study , RKB and RK were subjected to digestion and 24h-fermentation in order to study SCFA production and growth of selected saccharolytic bacteria . RESULTS	The test meals did not differ in their effect on parameters of subjective appetite sensation the following day . RESULTS	Ad libitum energy intake at lunch was , however , reduced by 11 % ( P < 0.01 ) after RKB and 7 % ( P < 0.05 ) after RK compared with after WWB evening meal . RESULTS	Breath hydrogen excretion was significantly increased following RKB and RK evening meals compared with WWB ( P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 , respectively ) . RESULTS	Overall , RKB and RK were readily fermented in vitro and exhibited similar fermentation profiles , although total SCFA production was higher for RK compared with RKB ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	In vitro fermentation of RKB and RK both increased the relative quantities of Bifidobacterium and decreased Bacteroides compared with inoculum ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The C. coccoides group was reduced after RKB ( P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of wholegrain rye products reduced subsequent ad libitum energy intake in young healthy men , possibly mediated by mechanisms related to colonic fermentation ."
"BACKGROUND	Opioid-induced constipation ( OIC ) is a common adverse effect of opioid therapy . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of naloxegol , an oral , peripherally acting - opioid receptor antagonist ( PAMORA ) , in patients with noncancer pain and OIC . METHODS	A 52-week , multicenter , open-label , randomised , parallel-group phase 3 study was conducted in out-patients taking 30-1000 morphine-equivalent units per day for 4 weeks . METHODS	Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive naloxegol 25 mg/day or usual-care ( UC ; investigator-chosen laxative regimen ) treatment for OIC . RESULTS	The safety set comprised 804 patients ( naloxegol , n = 534 ; UC , n = 270 ) . RESULTS	Mean exposure duration was 268 days with naloxegol and 297 days with UC . RESULTS	Frequency of adverse events ( AEs ) was 81.8 % with naloxegol and 72.2 % with UC . RESULTS	Treatment-emergent AEs occurring more frequently for naloxegol vs. UC were abdominal pain ( 17.8 % vs. 3.3 % ) , diarrhoea ( 12.9 % vs. 5.9 % ) , nausea ( 9.4 % vs. 4.1 % ) , headache ( 9.0 % vs. 4.8 % ) , flatulence ( 6.9 % vs. 1.1 % ) and upper abdominal pain ( 5.1 % vs. 1.1 % ) . RESULTS	Most naloxegol-emergent gastrointestinal AEs occurred early , resolving during or after naloxegol discontinuation and were mild or moderate in severity ; 11 patients discontinued due to diarrhoea and nine patients owing to abdominal pain . RESULTS	Pain scores and mean daily opioid doses remained stable throughout the study ; no attributable opioid withdrawal AEs were observed . RESULTS	Two patients in each group had an adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event unrelated to study drug ; no AEs were reported nor adjudicated as bowel perforations . CONCLUSIONS	In patients with noncancer pain and opioid-induced constipation , naloxegol 25 mg/day up to 52 weeks was generally safe and well tolerated ."
"BACKGROUND	Probiotics have a possible role in the treatment of pediatric acute gastroenteritis . BACKGROUND	We report the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) on intestinal function , immune response , and clinical outcomes in Indian children with cryptosporidial or rotavirus diarrhea . METHODS	Children with gastroenteritis aged 6 months to 5 years , testing positive for either rotavirus or Cryptosporidium species in stool ( coinfections were excluded ) , were randomized to LGG ( ATCC 53103 ) or placebo , once daily for 4 weeks . METHODS	Baseline demographic and clinical details were obtained . METHODS	Sera were tested for immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) antibodies to Cryptosporidium and rotavirus , and the lactulose to mannitol ratio for intestinal permeability was determined at baseline and at the end of follow-up . RESULTS	Of the 124 children enrolled , 82 and 42 had rotavirus and cryptosporidial diarrhea , respectively . RESULTS	Median diarrheal duration was 4 days ; one-third of the children had severe diarrhea . RESULTS	Baseline and clinical parameters were comparable between children receiving LGG and placebo . RESULTS	At the end of follow-up , fewer children with rotavirus diarrhea on LGG had repeated diarrheal episodes ( 25 % vs 46 % ; P = .048 ) and impaired intestinal function ( 48 % vs 72 % ; P = .027 ) . RESULTS	Significant increase in IgG levels postintervention ( 456 vs 2215 EU ; P = .003 ) was observed in children with rotavirus diarrhea receiving LGG . RESULTS	Among children with cryptosporidial diarrhea , those receiving LGG showed significant improvement in intestinal permeability . CONCLUSIONS	LGG has a positive immunomodulatory effect and may be useful in decreasing repeated episodes of rotavirus diarrhea . CONCLUSIONS	Improvement in intestinal function in children with rotavirus and cryptosporidial gastroenteritis emphasizes the role of probiotics in treating intestinal impairment after infection . BACKGROUND	CTRI/2010/091 / 000339 ."
"OBJECTIVE	To determine the impact of supplemental zinc , vitamin A , and glutamine alone or in combination on growth , intestinal barrier function , stress and satiety-related hormones among Brazilian shantytown children with low median height-for-age z-scores . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in children aged two months to nine years from the urban shanty compound community of Fortaleza , Brazil . METHODS	Demographic and anthropometric information was assessed . METHODS	The random treatment groups available for testing ( a total of 120 children ) were as follows : ( 1 ) glutamine alone , n = 38 ; ( 2 ) glutamine plus vitamin A plus zinc , n = 37 ; and a placebo ( zinc plus vitamin A vehicle ) plus glycine ( isonitrogenous to glutamine ) control treatment , n = 38 . METHODS	Leptin , adiponectin , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) , and plasma levels of cortisol were measured with immune-enzymatic assays ; urinary lactulose/mannitol and serum amino acids were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography . METHODS	ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT00133406 . RESULTS	Glutamine treatment significantly improved weight-for-height z-scores compared to the placebo-glycine control treatment . RESULTS	Either glutamine alone or all nutrients combined prevented disruption of the intestinal barrier function , as measured by the percentage of lactulose urinary excretion and the lactulose : mannitol absorption ratio . RESULTS	Plasma leptin was negatively correlated with plasma glutamine ( p = 0.002 ) and arginine ( p = 0.001 ) levels at baseline . RESULTS	After glutamine treatment , leptin was correlated with weight-for-age ( WAZ ) and weight-for-height z-scores ( WHZ ) ( p0 .002 ) at a 4-month follow-up . RESULTS	In addition , glutamine and all combined nutrients ( glutamine , vitamin A , and zinc ) improved the intestinal barrier function in these children . CONCLUSIONS	Taken together , these findings reveal the benefits of glutamine alone or in combination with other gut-trophic nutrients in growing children via interactions with leptin ."
"OBJECTIVE	To study the clinical efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) intervention `` tonifying the kidney to promote liver regeneration and repair by affecting stem cells and their microenvironment '' ( `` TTK '' ) for treating liver failure due to chronic hepatitis B. METHODS	We designed the study as a randomized controlled clinical trial . METHODS	Registration number of Chinese Clinical Trial Registry is ChiCTR-TRC-12002961 . METHODS	A total of 144 patients with liver failure due to infection with chronic hepatitis B virus were enrolled in this randomized controlled clinical study . METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to the following three groups : ( 1 ) a modern medicine control group ( MMC group , 36 patients ) ; ( 2 ) a `` tonifying qi and detoxification '' ( `` TQD '' ) group ( 72 patients ) ; and ( 3 ) a `` tonifying the kidney to promote liver regeneration and repair by affecting stem cells and their microenvironment '' ( `` TTK '' ) group ( 36 patients ) . METHODS	Patients in the MMC group received general internal medicine treatment ; patients in the `` TQD '' group were given a TCM formula `` tonifying qi and detoxification '' and general internal medicine treatment ; patients in the `` TTK '' group were given a TCM formula of `` TTK '' and general internal medicine treatment . METHODS	All participants were treated for 8 wk and then followed at 48 wk following their final treatment . METHODS	The primary efficacy end point was the patient fatality rate in each group . METHODS	Measurements of various virological and biochemical indicators served as secondary endpoints . METHODS	The one-way analysis of variance and the t-test were used to compare patient outcomes in the different treatment groups . RESULTS	At the 48-wk post-treatment time point , the patient fatality rates in the MMC , `` TQD '' , and `` TTK '' groups were 51.61 % , 35.38 % , and 16.67 % , respectively , and the differences between groups were statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	However , there were no significant differences in the levels of hepatitis B virus DNA or prothrombin activity among the three groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Patients in the `` TTK '' group had significantly higher levels of serum total bilirubin compared to MMC subjects ( 339.40 mol/L 270.09 mol/L vs 176.13 mol/L 185.70 mol/L , P = 0.014 ) . RESULTS	Serum albumin levels were significantly increased in both the `` TQD '' group and `` TTK '' group as compared with the MMC group ( 31.30 g/L 4.77 g/L , 30.72 g/L 2.89 g/L vs 28.57 g/L 4.56 g/L , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in levels of alanine transaminase among the three groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Safety data showed that there was one case of stomachache in the `` TQD '' group and one case of gastrointestinal side effect in the `` TTK '' group . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with `` TTK '' improved the survival rates of patients with liver failure due to chronic hepatitis B. Additionally , liver tissue was regenerated and liver function was restored ."
"BACKGROUND	Although scientific knowledge about the benefits of probiotic use in cystis fibrosis ( CF ) is scarce , their expectative is promising . BACKGROUND	The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of a Lactobacillus reuteri probiotic preparation versus placebo in CF patients . METHODS	A prospective , double blind , crossover and with placebo study was carried out in 30 CF patients from two Spanish hospitals . METHODS	Patients were randomized in Group A ( 6 months of probiotic followed by 6 months of placebo ) and Group B ( 6 months of placebo followed by 6 months of probiotic ) . METHODS	GIQLI ( gastrointestinal ) and SF-12 ( general ) health tests were performed after probiotic and placebo intakes . METHODS	Fat absorption coefficient , calprotectin , and inflammatory interleukin quantification were determined in fecal samples . METHODS	Total fecal DNA was obtained and metagenomic 454-pyrosequencing was applied to analyze the microbiome composition . METHODS	STATA v12 MP software was used for statistical analyses . RESULTS	Statistically significant improvement in the gastrointestinal health and decrease of the calprotectin levels were demonstrated in patients after probiotic exposure , in comparison with placebo . RESULTS	All CF subjects reported good tolerance to L. reuteri without secondary effects . RESULTS	Metagenomic analysis showed an important dysbiosis in CF gut microbiota associated with a high concentration of Proteobacteria . RESULTS	Probiotic intake was followed by a reduction in the total bacterial density , mostly due to a considerable reduction in the - Proteobacteria phylum ; and an important increase of the microbial diversity with a higher representation of Firmicutes . CONCLUSIONS	Probiotics might ameliorate the dysbiosis of CF gut microbiota , characterized by a high density of Proteobacterial organisms . CONCLUSIONS	L. reuteri significantly decrease intestinal inflammation and increase digestive comfort ."
"OBJECTIVE	To measure the pH , titratable acidity , fluoride concentration and erosive potential of brewed teas . METHODS	Bag teas were purchased to represent black , green , citrus , fruity , and floral tea flavors from Tulsi , Bigelow , HyVee , Tazo , and Yogi brands and brewed ( 1 bag/240 ml ) in boiling water for 3 minutes . METHODS	The pH , titratable acidity , and fluoride concentrations were measured . METHODS	Following these measurements , a representative tea from each flavor was selected for investigation of erosion potential . METHODS	Six extracted human molars were randomly assigned to each tea . METHODS	Teeth were painted with fingernail polish to expose a 1 x 4 mm window and then soaked in tea for a total of 25 hours with teas refreshed every 5 hours . METHODS	Teeth were then sectioned using a microtome and photographed using a polarized light microscope . METHODS	Lesion depths ( i.e. , eroded surfaces ) were measured using Image Pro Plus software . METHODS	Differences in physiochemical properties and lesion depths between beverages were investigated using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey 's HSD test . METHODS	Relationships among lesion depths and physiochemical properties were evaluated using the Pearson correlation test . RESULTS	pH , titratable acidity and fluoride concentrations differed between tea flavors ( P < 0.05 ) and between brands ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Lesion depths produced by the citrus tea ( 83.1 + / - 10.3 microm ) were greater than those produced by the fruity tea ( 56.5 + / - 6.1 microm ) ; both teas produced greater depths than black ( 30.1 + / - 7.4 microm ) , floral ( 25.0 + / - 3.2 microm ) or green ( 22.3 + / - 6.3 microm ) teas ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	pH ( r = -0.96 ; P = 0.009 ) was inversely and titratable acidity ( r = 0.97 ; P = 0.006 ) was positively associated with lesion depths ."
"BACKGROUND	Functional dyspepsia represents a frequent gastrointestinal disorder in clinical practice . BACKGROUND	According to the Roma III criteria , functional dyspepsia can be classified into two types as the predominant symptom : epigastric pain and postprandial discomfort . BACKGROUND	Even though the pathophysiology is still uncertain , the functional dyspepsia seems to be related to multiple mechanisms , among them visceral hypersensitivity , changes in the gastroduodenal motility and gastric accommodation and psychological factors . OBJECTIVE	Evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture as a complementary to conventional treatment in functional dyspepsia patients . METHODS	Randomized clinical trial in which were enrolled patients with functional dyspepsia patients in according with Rome III criteria . METHODS	One group was submitted to drug therapy and specific acupuncture ( GI ) and the other to drug therapy and non-specific acupuncture ( GII ) . METHODS	The gastrointestinal symptoms , presence of psychiatric disorders and quality of life were evaluated , at the end and three months after treatment . RESULTS	After 4 weeks of treatment there was improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms in Group I ( 55 12 vs 29 8.8 ; P = 0.001 ) and Group II ( 50.5 10.2 vs 46 10.5 ; P = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Quality of life was significantly better in Group I than group II ( 93.4 7.3 vs 102.4 5.1 ; P = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Anxiety ( 93.3 % vs 0 % ; P = 0.001 ) and depression ( 46.7 % vs 0 % ; P = 0.004 ) were significantly lower in Group I than group II . RESULTS	When comparing the two groups after 4 weeks of treatment , gastrointestinal symptoms ( 29 8.8 vs 46 10.5 ; P < 0.001 ) and quality of life ( 102.4 5.1 vs 96 6.1 ; P = 0.021 ) were significantly better in Group I than group II . RESULTS	Three months after the treatment , gastrointestinal symptoms remained better only in Group I , when compared to the pre-treatment values ( 38 11.3 vs 55 12 ; P = 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	In patients with functional dyspepsia the complementary acupuncture treatment is superior to conventional treatment . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies with more patients are needed to confirm these findings ."
"BACKGROUND	This exploratory study was the first study of remimazolam in patients to assess the safety and efficacy of different single doses for procedural sedation . METHODS	Patients scheduled to undergo a diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomized to receive 1 of 3 doses of remimazolam or midazolam ( 25 per group ) in a double-blind manner . METHODS	After a single dose of study drug to achieve sedation , patients underwent gastroscopy . METHODS	We assessed the success of the procedure , sedation levels , recovery from sedation , and safety . RESULTS	A single dose of remimazolam resulted in a successful procedure in 32 % , 56 % , and 64 % of patients in the low ( 0.10 ) , middle ( 0.15 ) , and high ( 0.20 mg/kg ) dose groups compared with 44 % of patients in the midazolam ( 0.075 mg/kg ) dose group . RESULTS	The onset of sedation was 1.5 to 2.5 minutes in the remimazolam dose groups compared with 5 minutes for midazolam . RESULTS	Because this was a single administration study , sedation could be maintained for as long as necessary to complete the procedure , using rescue midazolam or propofol . RESULTS	Recovery from sedation was rapid for all treatment groups but was influenced by the choice of rescue medication . RESULTS	There were no obvious differences in the safety profiles of remimazolam and midazolam . CONCLUSIONS	This exploratory dose-finding study showed that a single administration of remimazolam ( 0.10-0 .20 mg/kg ) was capable of inducing rapid sedation with a quick recovery profile in patients undergoing a diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . CONCLUSIONS	The safety profile was favorable and appeared to be similar to that of midazolam , warranting further development of this short-acting compound ."
"METHODS	In vitro and animal studies have shown differential colonic fermentation of structurally different prebiotics . METHODS	We evaluated the impact of two structurally different prebiotics ( wheat bran extract ( WBE , containing arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides ) and oligofructose ) on colonic fermentation and markers of bowel health in healthy volunteers . RESULTS	Nineteen healthy subjects completed a double-blind , cross-over randomized controlled trial . RESULTS	Interventions with WBE , oligofructose or placebo for 2 wk ( week 1 : 15 g/day ; week 2 : 30 g/day ) were separated by 2-wk wash-out periods . RESULTS	At the end of each study period , colonic fermentation was characterized through a metabolomics approach . RESULTS	Fecal water genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were determined using the comet and WST-1 assay , respectively , as parameters of gut health . RESULTS	Cluster analysis revealed differences in effects of WBE and oligofructose on colonic fermentation . RESULTS	WBE , but not oligofructose , reduced fecal p-cresol ( p = 0.009 ) and isovaleric acid concentrations ( p = 0.022 ) , markers of protein fermentation . RESULTS	Fecal water cytotoxicity was significantly lower after intake of WBE ( p = 0.015 ) . RESULTS	Both WBE - and oligofructose-intake tended to reduce fecal water genotoxicity compared to placebo ( WBE : p = 0.060 ; oligofructose : p = 0.057 ) . RESULTS	Changes in fermentation were not related to changes in fecal water toxicity . CONCLUSIONS	Structurally different prebiotics affect colonic fermentation and gut health in a different way ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess risk factors associated with substantial microbial bioburden of lids , conjunctivae , contact lenses , and storage cases during daily wear of silicone hydrogel contact lenses . METHODS	Two hundred eighteen patients were fit to lotrafilcon A lenses , randomized to use either a multipurpose solution or a hydrogen peroxide care system , and followed up for 1 year . METHODS	Lenses , lens transport saline , lids , conjunctivae , and storage cases were cultured and considered to have substantial microbial bioburden when they harbored high levels of commensal or pathogenic organisms . METHODS	Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine which demographic covariates were associated with significant bioburden at each location while controlling for solution use . RESULTS	In multivariate analyses , smoking trended toward an association with lens bioburden ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.15 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.95-4 .88 ) . RESULTS	Clerical occupations were found to be associated with more frequent overall storage case contamination ( OR = 3.51 , 95 % CI : 1.15-10 .70 ) and , specifically , higher gram-positive storage case contamination ( OR = 5.57 , 95 % CI : 1.82-17 .06 ) . RESULTS	The peroxide system was associated with more frequent storage case contamination ( OR = 7.6 , 95 % CI : 3.79-15 .19 ) . RESULTS	Coagulase-negative staphylococci ( CNS ) were the most frequently cultured organisms within storage cases , and in multivariate analyses , CNS were more frequently found in storage cases of peroxide users ( OR = 6.12 , 95 % CI : 2.91-13 .09 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Clerical occupations were associated with increased microbial bioburden of storage cases during daily wear of silicone hydrogel lenses . CONCLUSIONS	Smoking may increase the risk of lens contamination . CONCLUSIONS	Storage cases are most frequently contaminated with normal skin flora , and peroxide cases were associated with more frequent contamination . CONCLUSIONS	However , the solution type was not associated with lid or lens contamination nor with corneal infiltrative events in this study ."
"BACKGROUND	Stroke volume variation ( SVV ) and pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) , termed dynamic markers of preload responsiveness , may predict the response to i.v. fluid in critically ill patients . BACKGROUND	However , the predictive accuracy of these variables during gastrointestinal surgery remains uncertain . METHODS	Observational study of patients aged 50 yr undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery , enrolled in the OPTIMISE trial . METHODS	Patients received six 250 ml fluid challenges with i.v. colloid solution ( three during and three after surgery ) , while SVV and PPV were measured using the LiDCOrapid monitor ( LiDCO Ltd , UK ) . METHODS	Fluid responsiveness was defined as a stroke volume increase 10 % . METHODS	Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated with 95 % confidence intervals . METHODS	Adjustment for covariates was performed by regression modelling and a clustering method was used to adjust for intra-patient correlation . RESULTS	One hundred patients were recruited between August 2010 and October 2012 . RESULTS	Five hundred and fifty-six fluid challenges were administered and 159 ( 28.6 % ) were associated with increased stroke volume . RESULTS	The predictive value of both variables was poor during surgery [ SVV 0.69 ( 0.63-0 .77 ) ; PPV 0.70 ( 0.62-0 .77 ) ] , and also after surgery [ SVV 0.69 ( 0.63-0 .78 ) ; PPV 0.64 ( 0.56-0 .73 ) ] . RESULTS	The findings were similar when analysed according to whether patients were mechanically ventilated [ SVV 0.68 ( 0.63-0 .77 ) ; PPV 0.69 ( 0.61-0 .77 ) ] or breathing spontaneously [ SVV 0.69 ( 0.61-0 .77 ) ; PPV 0.63 ( 0.56-0 .72 ) ] . RESULTS	Predictive value improved slightly in a sensitivity analysis excluding outlier values of SVV and PPV . CONCLUSIONS	In this study , the predictive accuracy of SVV and PPV for fluid responsiveness was insufficient to recommend for routine clinical use during or after major gastrointestinal surgery ."
"OBJECTIVE	We suggest an alternative chest compression ( CC ) in kneeling posture using a ` kneeling stool ' on which the performer kneels beside the patient on a bed in-hospital . OBJECTIVE	In kneeling posture , we can maintain high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) without the bed height adjustment , which is necessary and inconvenient in standing posture . METHODS	This study is a randomised crossover trial with 38 participants working in one ED . METHODS	The first group knelt on the kneeling stool beside a manikin placed on a bed , whereas the second group stood on a step stool with the manikin at knee level using bed height adjustment . METHODS	All the participants performed continuous chest compression for 5 min without audio-visual feedback . METHODS	After that , the posture was changed in each group . METHODS	The parameters of CC quality ( CC depth , rate , accuracy , and incomplete chest recoil ) , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) for fatigue and pain , and preference of participants were compared between the two groups . RESULTS	The data of 33 participants in both postures were analysed following exclusion of five participants . RESULTS	In the comparisons overall and per minute between the two postures , the parameters and VAS do not differ significantly ( all P > 0.05 ) except for the median 1st CC rate that was faster in kneeling posture than in standing posture , P = 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Twenty-three performers preferred the kneeling posture . CONCLUSIONS	A kneeling posture with a kneeling stool were preferred by participants , which have shown similar results in CC parameters and VAS with a standing posture on a stepstool with bed height adjustment during in-hospital CPR ."
"BACKGROUND	Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) is an important growth factor in regulation of cell proliferation , differentiation , survival and apoptosis . BACKGROUND	Studies showed that food-grade Lactococcus lactis ( L. lactis ) and NICE expression system have superior performance in exogenous protein expression . BACKGROUND	This study aimed to construct and express porcine EGF ( pEGF ) , and use L. lactis as vehicle for producing and delivering pEGF . BACKGROUND	Furthermore , investigating biological activity of pEGF and exploring applications feasibility of combination effects of L. lactis and pEGF on early weaned piglets ' production . RESULTS	A recombinant Lactococcus lactis which produced and secreted pEGF at 1000 ng/ml in culture supernatant was generated . RESULTS	Secreted pEGF was a fully biologically active protein , as demonstrated by its capacity to stimulate L929 mouse fibroblast cell line proliferation in vitro . RESULTS	For in vivo study , forty piglets were randomly allocated to control , antibiotic control , empty vector-expressing L. lactis ( LL-EV ) and pEGF-secreting L. lactis ( LL-pEGF ) . RESULTS	After 14 d of rearing , final body weight and average daily gain in LL-pEGF were greater ( P < 0.05 , 8.95 vs. 8.37 kg , 206.1 vs. 157.7 g/day , respectively ) than those in control , but no significant differences between LL-pEGF , LL-EV and antibiotic control . RESULTS	Overall period average daily feed intake was higher in LL-pEGF , LL-EV and antibiotic control than in control ( P < 0.05 , 252.9 , 255.6 , 250.0 , 207.3 g/day , respectively ) . RESULTS	No significant difference was observed on ADFI/ADG . RESULTS	LL-pEGF increased villous height in the duodenum , jejunum and ileum than in control and LL-EV ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Sucrase in the 3 intestinal segments , aminopeptidase A in the duodenum and Jejunum , aminopeptidase N and dipeptidase IV in the duodenum in LL-pEGF were higher than those in control ( P < 0.05 ) .

CONCLUSIONS	We have generated a recombinant Lactococcus lactis which produced and secreted fully biologically active porcine EGF . CONCLUSIONS	Oral administration of pEGF-secreting L. lactis had beneficial effects on intestinal health and performance of early-weaned piglets ."
"BACKGROUND	Early enteral feeding through a nasoenteric feeding tube is often used in patients with severe acute pancreatitis to prevent gut-derived infections , but evidence to support this strategy is limited . BACKGROUND	We conducted a multicenter , randomized trial comparing early nasoenteric tube feeding with an oral diet at 72 hours after presentation to the emergency department in patients with acute pancreatitis . METHODS	We enrolled patients with acute pancreatitis who were at high risk for complications on the basis of an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 8 or higher ( on a scale of 0 to 71 , with higher scores indicating more severe disease ) , an Imrie or modified Glasgow score of 3 or higher ( on a scale of 0 to 8 , with higher scores indicating more severe disease ) , or a serum C-reactive protein level of more than 150 mg per liter . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to nasoenteric tube feeding within 24 hours after randomization ( early group ) or to an oral diet initiated 72 hours after presentation ( on-demand group ) , with tube feeding provided if the oral diet was not tolerated . METHODS	The primary end point was a composite of major infection ( infected pancreatic necrosis , bacteremia , or pneumonia ) or death during 6 months of follow-up . RESULTS	A total of 208 patients were enrolled at 19 Dutch hospitals . RESULTS	The primary end point occurred in 30 of 101 patients ( 30 % ) in the early group and in 28 of 104 ( 27 % ) in the on-demand group ( risk ratio , 1.07 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.79 to 1.44 ; P = 0.76 ) . RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the early group and the on-demand group in the rate of major infection ( 25 % and 26 % , respectively ; P = 0.87 ) or death ( 11 % and 7 % , respectively ; P = 0.33 ) . RESULTS	In the on-demand group , 72 patients ( 69 % ) tolerated an oral diet and did not require tube feeding . CONCLUSIONS	This trial did not show the superiority of early nasoenteric tube feeding , as compared with an oral diet after 72 hours , in reducing the rate of infection or death in patients with acute pancreatitis at high risk for complications .

"OBJECTIVE	Several case series have reported the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) for ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . OBJECTIVE	We assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for patients with UC in a double-blind randomized trial . METHODS	Patients with mild to moderately active UC ( n = 50 ) were assigned to groups that underwent FMT with feces from healthy donors or were given autologous fecal microbiota ( control ) ; each transplant was administered via nasoduodenal tube at the start of the study and 3 weeks later . METHODS	The study was performed at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam from June 2011 through May 2014 . METHODS	The composite primary end point was clinical remission ( simple clinical colitis activity index scores 2 ) combined with 1-point decrease in the Mayo endoscopic score at week 12 . METHODS	Secondary end points were safety and microbiota composition by phylogenetic microarray in fecal samples . RESULTS	Thirty-seven patients completed the primary end point assessment . RESULTS	In the intention-to-treat analysis , 7 of 23 patients who received fecal transplants from healthy donors ( 30.4 % ) and 5 of 25 controls ( 20.0 % ) achieved the primary end point ( P = .51 ) . RESULTS	In the per-protocol analysis , 7 of 17 patients who received fecal transplants from healthy donors ( 41.2 % ) and 5 of 20 controls ( 25.0 % ) achieved the primary end point ( P = .29 ) . RESULTS	Serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients ( 2 in the FMT group ) , but these were not considered to be related to the FMT . RESULTS	At 12 weeks , the microbiota of responders in the FMT group was similar to that of their healthy donors ; remission was associated with proportions of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa . CONCLUSIONS	In this phase 2 trial , there was no statistically significant difference in clinical and endoscopic remission between patients with UC who received fecal transplants from healthy donors and those who received their own fecal microbiota , which may be due to limited numbers . CONCLUSIONS	However , the microbiota of responders had distinct features from that of nonresponders , warranting further study . CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov Number : NCT01650038 ."

"BACKGROUND	Ex vivo evidence suggests that cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) 2-preferential inhibitor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , such as meloxicam , have a less detrimental effect on intestinal healing than flunixin meglumine ( FM ) . BACKGROUND	Whether this translates to a beneficial effect in horses with naturally occurring strangulating small intestinal ( SSI ) lesions is unknown . OBJECTIVE	To compare the clinical outcome of horses with naturally occurring SSI lesions treated with meloxicam or FM . METHODS	Randomised prospective study . METHODS	Cases presenting to the Royal Veterinary College Equine Referral Hospital and Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic during 2010 and 2011 in which an SSI lesion was identified at exploratory laparotomy were eligible for inclusion . METHODS	Horses received either 1.1 mg/kg bwt FM or 0.6 mg/kg bwt meloxicam i.v. q. 12h . METHODS	Clinical outcomes and clinical and laboratory parameters associated with endotoxaemia were compared between groups . RESULTS	Sixty cases were enrolled , 32 horses received FM and 28 received meloxicam . RESULTS	There was no difference in signalment , physical examination or surgical factors between groups . RESULTS	The overall survival to discharge was 81 % ; there was no difference in survival ( P = 0.14 ) or incidence of post operative ileus ( P = 0.25 ) between groups . RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the plasma lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) concentrations at 0h ( P = 0.18 ) or 48h ( P = 0.60 ) ; however , there was a significant difference between neutrophil count at 48h ( P < 0.05 ) and at 96h ( P < 0.01 ) with significantly greater cell numbers in horses receiving meloxicam compared with FM . RESULTS	Blinded pain score evaluation showed that more horses receiving meloxicam showed gross signs of pain than those treated with FM ( P = 0.04 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug choice did not affect major clinical outcomes in horses with SSI lesions but had some effects on signs of pain . CONCLUSIONS	This study provides no evidence to recommend one NSAID treatment above another based on survival or the incidence of ileus ; however , evaluation of a larger number of cases is required ."
"OBJECTIVE	Lactobacilli have been found in the neovagina of very low numbers of transsexual women . OBJECTIVE	We undertook this study to determine whether an orally administered preparation of four lactobacilli strains exerts some measurable effect on the neovaginal microflora of female transsexuals . METHODS	60 male to female transsexual women with penile linked neovagina were randomised into two groups . METHODS	Women in the intervention group ( n = 33 ) received oral probiotic capsules and women in the control group ( n = 27 ) placebo in for 7 days . METHODS	Swabs of the neovagina were taken before and after the therapy .

METHODS	Forty patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II and III undergoing elective open resection of malignant colorectal tumours were included in this study . METHODS	Using a sealed envelope method , the patients were randomly divided into two groups either receiving EA ( EA group ) or sham EA ( SEA group ) . METHODS	Data regarding the recovery of bowel function ( times to the first bowel sounds , passage of flatus and defaecation ) were collected and analysed . RESULTS	In the EA group , the time intervals from surgery to the first bowel movement and passage of flatus were shorter than in the SEA group ( 1310h vs 1913h , p < 0.05 and 2314h vs 3218h , p < 0.05 , respectively ) . RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the time to first defaecation ( 6845h vs 7253h , p > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	EA at ST36 accelerates the recovery of gastrointestinal motility after colorectal surgery . BACKGROUND	JJ22011-15 ."
"BACKGROUND	Several studies indicate that increasing the alimentary limb length in gastric bypass surgery produces only a minor improvement of excess BMI loss . BACKGROUND	Few studies have addressed the efficacy of increasing the length of the pancreatico-biliary limb . METHODS	Here , we present a prospective randomized study of 187 consecutive laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass operations operated over 2 years ( 2004-2005 ) in Iceland . METHODS	The patients were operated with a gastric bypass with either a 2-m biliopancreatic ( BP ) - limb and a 60-cm alimentary ( A ) - limb ( n = 93 ) or with a 150-cm A-limb and a 60-cm BP-limb ( n = 94 ) . RESULTS	Preoperative median BMI was 44.1 ( 38-70 ) , median age 35.5 ( 17-74 ) years , and 85 % of the patients were female . RESULTS	Follow-up rate after 5 years was 85 % . RESULTS	Eighteen months following surgery , the weight loss was significantly higher in the BP-limb group ( p < 0.001 ) , and this difference remained 7 years after surgery . RESULTS	Weight regain occurred in both groups , and 7 years after surgery , excess BMI loss ( EBMIL ) was 78.4 % in the BP-limb group compared to 67.1 % in the A-limb group ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Most patients ( 78 % ) needed supplementation adjustment ( iron , vitamin D and calcium ) during the study period , significantly more often in the BP-limb group compared to the A-limb group ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Patients in the BP-limb group had more frequent stools than patients in the A-limb group ; otherwise , gastro-intestinal symptoms rating scoring were comparable . RESULTS	Complication rate was similar . CONCLUSIONS	Gastric bypass with a 2-m BP-limb gives better weight loss than gastric bypass with a 60-cm BP-limb and a 150-cm A-limb . CONCLUSIONS	Metabolic follow-up is of utmost importance , as most patients needed repeated adjustments of their supplementation ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yigan Fupi Decoction ( YFD ) in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea ( IBS-D ) patients . METHODS	A randomized controlled clinical trail was carried out in patients with IBS-D . METHODS	All patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group ( 58 cases , treated with YFD ) and the control group ( 58 cases , treated with Pinaverium Bromide Tablet ) . METHODS	The treatment course was 4 weeks for all patients . METHODS	The total effective rate , the stool property and state , the quality of life ( QOL ) , and TCM syndrome efficacy were assessed by IBS bowel symptom severity scale ( IBS-BSS ) , IBS defecation state questionnaire ( IBS-DSQ ) , IBS quality of life questionnaire ( IBS-QOL ) , and traditional Chinese medicine pattern curative effect scoring system ( TCM-PES ) before and after treatment . RESULTS	There was no statistical difference in the total effective rate between the two groups ( 82.76 % vs. 77.59 % , P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The treatment group was superior in the total IBS-BSS integral to the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The total effective rate of improving the stool property was better in the treatment group than in the control group ( 81.03 % vs. 72.41 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Besides , the number of days for emergent defecation among 10 days was less in the treatment group than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The improvement of the total IBS-QOL integral and the total integral of TCM syndrome were better in the treatment group than in the control group ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	The total effective rate of TCM-PES was better in the treatment group than in the control group ( 84.48 % vs. 70.69 % , P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	YFD was effective in the treatment of IBS-D patients of Gan-qi invading Pi syndrome , and could effectively relieve bowel symptoms , improve the stool property and the defecation frequency , elevate their QOL , and attenuate Gan-qi invading Pi syndrome with favorable safety and compliance ."
"BACKGROUND	Oral iron supplementation is often associated with rapid onset of gastrointestinal side-effects . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to develop and trial a short , simple questionnaire to capture these early side-effects and to determine which symptoms are more discriminating . METHODS	The study was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized parallel trial with one week treatment followed by one week wash-out . METHODS	Subjects were randomized into two treatment groups ( n = 10/group ) to receive either ferrous sulphate ( 200mg capsules containing 65mg of iron ) or placebo , both to be taken at mealtimes twice daily during the treatment period . METHODS	Subjects completed the questionnaires daily for 14days . METHODS	The questionnaire included gastrointestinal symptoms commonly reported to be associated with the oral intake of ferrous iron salts ( i.e. nausea , vomiting , heartburn , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , and constipation ) . RESULTS	Seventy five per cent of participants reporting the presence of one or more symptoms in the first week of the study were in the ferrous sulphate group . RESULTS	In the second week of the study ( i.e. wash-out ) , 67 % of the participants reporting one or more symptom ( s ) were in the ferrous sulphate group . RESULTS	In the first week of the study ( treatment ) the number of symptoms reported by participants in the ferrous sulphate group ( meanSEM = 6.71.7 ) was significantly higher than that for participants in the placebo group ( 1.20.5 ) ( p = 0.01 ) . RESULTS	In the second week of the study ( wash-out ) the number of symptoms reported by participants in the ferrous sulphate group ( 4.62.0 ) appeared higher than for participants in the placebo group ( 1.00.7 ) although this did not reach significance ( p = 0.12 ) . RESULTS	Events for which the gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire was most discriminatory between ferrous sulphate and placebo groups were : heartburn , abdominal pain and the presence of black stools ( all p0 .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS	A tool for the detection of commonly-occurring side effects should not require large study numbers to be effective . CONCLUSIONS	With just 10 subjects per group ( iron or placebo ) , this simple questionnaire measures gastrointestinal side-effects associated with oral iron ( ferrous sulphate ) supplementation , and would be appropriate for use in intervention studies or clinical trials .

"BACKGROUND	Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) is among the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide . BACKGROUND	In selected patients with severe diarrhoea-predominant or mixed IBS subtypes sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) alleviates IBS-specific symptoms and improves quality of life . BACKGROUND	The mode of action , however , remains unknown . BACKGROUND	The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of SNS on small intestinal motility in IBS patients . METHODS	Twenty patients treated with SNS for severe diarrhoea-predominant or mixed IBS were included in a randomised , controlled , crossover study . METHODS	The neurostimulator was turned ON or OFF for the first one month and then to the opposite setting for the next month . METHODS	Gastrointestinal transit patterns were investigated with the Motility Tracking System-1 ( MTS-1 ) at the end of each the ON and OFF period . METHODS	Primary endpoint was change in the velocity of the magnetic pill within the small intestine . METHODS	Statistical testing was performed with Wilcoxon 's rank sum test and Fisher 's exact test . RESULTS	The median velocity of the magnetic pill through the small intestine in the fasting state was not significantly different between periods with and without SNS ( Group ON-OFF : median change 0 m/h ( range -1.07 , 0.63 ) , Group OFF-ON : median change 0.27 m/h ( range -0.59 , 1.12 ) ) ( p = 0.25 ) . RESULTS	Neither , was the median velocity of the magnetic pill through the small intestine in the postprandial state significantly different between periods with and without SNS ( Group ON-OFF : median change -0.13 m/h ( range -0.46 , 0.23 ) , Group OFF-ON : median change 0.015 m/h ( range -0.48 , 0.59 ) ) ( p = 0.14 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Even though SNS may reduce symptoms of diarrhoea-predominant and mixed IBS , it has no detectable effect on small intestinal transit patterns .

"BACKGROUND	Despite the laparoscopic approach becoming the standard in colorectal surgery , postoperative pain management for minimally invasive surgery is still mainly based on strategies that have been established for open surgical procedures . BACKGROUND	Patient-controlled epidural and intravenous analgesia are considered standard postoperative analgesia regimens in colorectal surgery . BACKGROUND	Epidural analgesia provides excellent analgesia , but is increasingly scrutinized in laparoscopic surgery since postoperative pain after the laparoscopic approach is significantly reduced . BACKGROUND	Moreover , epidural analgesia can be associated with numerous complications . BACKGROUND	Therefore , epidural analgesia is no longer recommended for the management of postoperative pain in laparoscopic colorectal surgery . BACKGROUND	Likewise , patient-controlled intravenous analgesia is subject to significant side effects . BACKGROUND	Given these important limitations of the traditional strategies for postoperative analgesia , effective and efficient alternatives in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery are needed . BACKGROUND	Both the transversus abdominis plane block and systemically administered lidocaine have already been reported to effectively reduce pain after laparoscopic colorectal surgery . BACKGROUND	We hypothesize that the transversus abdominis plane block is superior to perioperative intravenous lidocaine . METHODS	One hundred and twenty five patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery will be included in this prospective , randomized , double-blind controlled clinical trial . METHODS	Patients will be randomly allocated to three different postoperative strategies : postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with morphine ( control group , n = 25 ) , a transversus abdominis plane block with ropivacaine 0.375 % at the end of surgery plus postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with morphine ( TAP group , n = 50 ) , or perioperative intravenous lidocaine plus postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with morphine ( LIDO group , n = 50 ) . METHODS	As the primary outcome parameter , we will evaluate the opioid consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours . METHODS	Secondary endpoints include the Numeric Rating Scale , time to return of intestinal function , time to mobilization , inflammatory response , incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting , length of hospital stay and postoperative morbidity as assessed with the Clavien-Dindo classification . CONCLUSIONS	Recognizing the importance of a multimodal approach for perioperative pain management , we aim to investigate whether a transversus abdominis plane block delivers superior pain control in comparison to perioperative intravenous lidocaine and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with morphine alone .

"OBJECTIVE	Currently available preparations for colonoscopy have low tolerability and may cause fluid and electrolyte shifts . OBJECTIVE	An alternative method of bowel cleansing is required . METHODS	Preparation of the gut using oral nutritional supplements ( ONS ) and rectal enema was tested as an alternative method of bowel cleansing . METHODS	During 2008-2012 , patients were randomized to oral nutritional supplements ( n = 27 ) for 5 days and rectal enema or polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) ( n = 23 ) prior to colonoscopy . METHODS	Blinded endoscopists rated the degree of bowel cleansing according to the Ottawa bowel preparation scale ( OBS ) ( primary outcome ) . METHODS	Tolerability of either preparation was also assessed ( ClinicalTrials.gov . METHODS	Identifier no : NCT00123456 ) . RESULTS	Due to a high rate of bowel cleansing failure among patients receiving ONS , the study was interrupted prematurely . RESULTS	Colonoscopies were incomplete due to stools in 6 of 27 patients in the ONS group compared to 1 of 23 in the PEG group ( ns ) . RESULTS	The mean total OBS were 8.3 3.3 and 5.3 2.8 , respectively ( p = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	Four patients ( 15 % ) in the ONS group and eight patients ( 35 % ) receiving PEG had an OBS score 4 ( good preparation ) ( ns ) . RESULTS	ONS was better tolerated than PEG with more patients reporting acceptable taste ( 27 of 27 [ 100 % ] vs. 15 of 23 [ 65 % ] , p = 0.001 ) , and fewer reporting difficulties with the intake ( 0 of 27 [ 0 % ] vs. 10 of 23 [ 43 % ] , p < 0.001 ) and nausea ( 5 of 27 [ 19 % ] vs. 13 of 23 [ 57 % ] , p < 0.008 ) . CONCLUSIONS	For routine use , ONS with enema instead of traditional preparation for colonoscopy with PEG can not be generally recommended ."
"BACKGROUND	Post-operative nasogastric intubation after emergency laparotomy is a common practice in many centers , with the intent of hastening the return of bowel function , relieving gastrointestinal discomfort , reducing various post-operative complications and reducing hospital stay . BACKGROUND	However , bowel rest and gastric decompression have been re-examined in the light of more recent data . BACKGROUND	Many studies and meta-analyses over the last 50 years have challenged the routine use of nasogastric tubes after laparotomy . BACKGROUND	The objective of this study is to evaluate the need for routine nasogastric decompression after emergency laparotomy . METHODS	A prospective , randomized controlled trial was conducted for 12 months ( May 1 , 2007 to Apr 30 , 2008 ) in the Department of Surgery , Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital , after ethical approval . METHODS	Patients were enrolled as per criteria ( Box 1 ) , and subsequently allocated by simple randomization into two groups : Group 1 and Group 2 . METHODS	Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis , intestinal obstruction and abdominal trauma were randomized to two groups - with or without nasogastric tube after surgery . METHODS	Gastric upset , return of bowel function and postoperative complications were compared . RESULTS	Total of 115 patients met the inclusion criteria . RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of gastric upset ( P : 0.38 ) , wound complications ( P : 0.30 ) , respiratory complications ( P : 0.30 ) and anastomotic leak ( P : 0.64 ) between two groups . RESULTS	Bowel function returned in comparable times in both groups ( correlation coefficient : 0.14 ; P : 0.54 ) . RESULTS	Nasogastric tube had to be reinserted in three patients in the group with nasogastric decompression postoperatively , and four in the group without ( P : 0.43 ) . RESULTS	Thus , routine nasogastric decompression neither prevented the development of gastrointestinal discomfort nor precluded the need for tube replacement once it was discontinued . RESULTS	For every patient who required post-operative nasogastric decompression , at least 14 patients were spared one . RESULTS	Mean hospital stay was significantly more in the decompressed group ( 7.52 days ; correlation coefficient : 0.22 ; P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	This study has shown that the prophylactic nasogastric decompression following emergency laparotomy is ineffective in achieving any of the intended goals .

"BACKGROUND	The open Burch colposuspension , first described in 1961 had been widely employed for the surgical treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) caused by urethral hypermobility . BACKGROUND	We evaluated the long-term efficacy of laparoscopic Burch colposuspension ( LBC ) for SUI in women . METHODS	A randomized prospective trial was conducted from September 2010 to January 2013 . METHODS	The extraperitoneal laparoscopic Burch colposuspension was performed by an operator on 96 women , mean age was 54,3 3,7 years all of whom suffered from SUI or mixed urinary incontinence . METHODS	Patients completed a self-administered the Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , the Physical Component Summary ( PCS ) and Mental Component Summary ( MCS ) , the Short Urinary Distress Inventory ( SUDI ) and Short Incontinence Impact Questionnaire ( SIIQ ) . METHODS	at both baseline and follow up ( 6 weeks , 6 months , 18 months postoperatively ) . METHODS	The Genito-Urinary Treatment Satisfaction Scale ( GUTSS ) was used to assess satisfaction with surgery . RESULTS	After follow up was recorded an improvement of questionnaries scores . RESULTS	The general health score is improved after surgery ( 2,60 1.02 versus 2,76 1.06 ) with p = 0.09 . RESULTS	The PCS baseline score is 46.29 10.95 versus 49.54 10.41 after treatment with p = 0.01 , so there was a significant baseline to follow up improvement . RESULTS	The MCS improved also , infact baseline score is 42.19 12.57 versus 42.70 13.03 with p = 0.87 . RESULTS	The SUDI baseline score is 50.22 20.73 versus 23.92 17.90 , while SIIQ score is 49.98 23.90 versus 31.40 23.83 with p < 0.01 . RESULTS	In both questionnaires there is an improvement . RESULTS	Satisfaction with treatment outcomes from the GUTSS at 6-month follow up is 29.5 6.3 with p = 0.46 . CONCLUSIONS	The LBC has significant advantages , without any apparent compromise in short-term and long term outcomes ."
"METHODS	Equol is produced by the intestinal bacteria from isoflavone daidzein . METHODS	Studies have reported the health benefits of soy can only present or more pronounced in equol producers . METHODS	This 6-month randomized controlled trial examined the effect of whole soy ( soy flour ) and purified daidzein on cardiovascular biomarkers and carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) in prehypertensive postmenopausal women who were equol producers . RESULTS	Two hundred seventy eligible women were randomized to either one of the three treatments : 40 g soy flour ( whole soy group ) , 40 g low-fat milk powder + 63mg daidzein ( daidzein group ) , or 40 g low-fat milk powder ( placebo group ) daily each for 6 months . RESULTS	Fasting venous samples were obtained at baseline and end of trial for testing glucose , lipids , high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , and free fatty acid .

"OBJECTIVE	: Although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases , the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial . OBJECTIVE	This study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) and permeability in chronic liver disease . METHODS	Fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo . METHODS	Six bacterial species were used : Bifidobacterium bifidum , Bifidobacterium lactis , Bifidobacterium longum , Lactobacillus acidophilus , Lactobacillus rhamnosus , and Streptococcus thermophilus . METHODS	After 4 weeks , changes in the composition of fecal bacteria , SIBO , intestinal permeability , and clinical symptoms were examined . RESULTS	Three of the six probiotic species , B. lactis , L. rhamnosus , and L. acidophilus , increased in the feces of the probiotic therapy group ( P < 0.001 ) , whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group . RESULTS	SIBO disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group , but none in the placebo ( 24 vs. 0 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	General gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm ( 50 vs. 31.3 % , P = 0.248 ) . RESULTS	Numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability ( P for trend < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group . CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating SIBO and clinical symptoms , but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function ."
"OBJECTIVE	Randomized controlled trials in developed countries have reported benefits of Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea , but there is paucity of such data from India . OBJECTIVE	The study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus GG in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children from a semi-urban city in north India . METHODS	In this open labelled , randomized controlled trial 2000 children with acute watery diarrhoea , aged between 6 months to 5 years visiting outpatient department and emergency room of a teaching hospital in north India were enrolled . METHODS	The children were randomized into receiving either Lactobacillus GG in dose of 10 billion cfu/day for five days or no probiotic medication in addition to standard WHO management of diarrhoea . METHODS	Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and time to change in consistency of stools . RESULTS	Median ( inter quartile range ) duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter in children in LGG group [ 60 ( 54-72 ) h vs. 78 ( 72-90 ) h ; P < 0.001 ] . RESULTS	Also , there was faster improvement in stool consistency in children receiving Lactobacillus GG than control group [ 36 ( 30-36 ) h vs. 42 ( 36-48 ) h ; P < 0.001 ] . RESULTS	There was significant reduction in average number of stools per day in LGG group ( P < 0.001 ) compared to the control group .

"OBJECTIVE	Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with advanced liver disease . OBJECTIVE	Probiotics alter the intestinal microbiota with non-urease-producing organisms that reduce production of ammonia . OBJECTIVE	We investigated the efficacy of probiotics for the primary prophylaxis of HE . METHODS	We conducted a prospective trial at a tertiary care referral institute in New Delhi , India , from January 2012 through March 2013 , of patients with cirrhosis without overt HE ( age , 48.6 11.1 y ; 96 men and 64 women ) ; 25 were Child-Turcotte-Pugh ( CTP ) class A , 51 were CTP class B , and 84 were CTP class C. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given probiotics ( 1 10 ( 8 ) colony-forming units , 3 times daily ; n = 86 , 42 with minimal HE ) or no test article ( control , n = 74 ; 33 with minimal HE ) . METHODS	All subjects underwent psychometric analyses , critical flicker fusion ( CFF ) threshold assessments , glucose hydrogen breath tests to identify small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) , and lactulose hydrogen breath tests to measure orocecal transit time ( OCTT ) . METHODS	The primary end point was the development of overt HE . RESULTS	At baseline , subjects in each group had comparable CTP score , model for end-stage liver disease scores , CFF assessments , psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores , and OCTT . RESULTS	After a mean follow-up period of 38.6 8.80 weeks for patients given probiotics and 40.3 9.8 weeks for controls , 6 patients given probiotics and 7 controls died ( P = .81 ) . RESULTS	Three months of probiotic administration significantly reduced levels of arterial ammonia , SIBO , and OCTT ; increased psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores ; and increased CFF thresholds , compared with baseline . RESULTS	Seven subjects in the probiotic group and 14 controls developed overt HE ( P < .05 ; hazard ratio for controls vs probiotic group , 2.1 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.31-6 .53 ) . RESULTS	Psychometric hepatic encephalopathy scores , CTP scores , and SIBO correlated with the development of overt HE . CONCLUSIONS	In a prospective , randomized controlled trial , probiotics were found to be effective in preventing HE in patients with cirrhosis .

METHODS	Patients in the treatment group were given DCQT made from decocted herbs and administered via nasojejunal tube at a dosage of 150 mL . METHODS	Gastrointestinal motility was assessed by recording time for recovery of bowel sounds , flatus , defecation , and the total amount of gastric drainage during the first three postoperative days . METHODS	Plasma motilin ( MTL ) and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) were measured one hour before and three days after surgery . RESULTS	Compared with the control group , the times to first bowel sound , flatus , and defecation were significantly shorter and there was less gastric drainage in the treatment group ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 , and P < 0.05 , respectively ) . RESULTS	In the treatment group , postoperative plasma MTL was significantly higher ( P < 0.01 ) and VIP was significantly lower than those in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no difference found in either MTL or VIP from before to after operation in the treatment group ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	MTL was significantly lower and VIP was higher postoperatively in the control group , compared to before surgery ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Modified DCQT effectively improved decreased gastrointestinal motility in postoperative esophageal cancer patients by increasing MTL and reducing VIP ."
"BACKGROUND	In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled birth cohort , we have recently shown a beneficial effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 ( HN001 ) for the prevention of eczema in children through to 6years of age but no effect of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis HN019 ( HN019 ) . OBJECTIVE	Among this cohort of children , we aim to investigate whether these probiotics could modify the expression of genetic predisposition to eczema conferred by genetic variation in susceptibility genes . METHODS	Thirty-three eczema susceptibility SNPs ( in eleven genes ) were genotyped in 331 children of European ancestry . RESULTS	Children who carried a genetic variant that put them at a high risk of developing eczema were less likely to develop eczema if they had been randomized to the HN001 intervention group compared to those in the placebo group . RESULTS	HN019 was also able to protect against the effects of some SNPs . RESULTS	As well as modifying genetic susceptibility to childhood eczema , HN001 was also found to modify genetic susceptibility to eczema severity and atopy risk . CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study to show an effect of a probiotic on reducing eczema risk amongst those with particular eczema-associated genotypes . CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 may be particularly effective in preventing eczema in children with specific high-risk genotypes ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of high - and low-dose oral , delayed-release mesalamine in a randomized , double-blind , active control study of children with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis . METHODS	Patients ages 5 to 17 years , with a Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index ( PUCAI ) score of 10 to 55 and a truncated Mayo Score of 1 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency , were enrolled . METHODS	They received body weight-dependent doses of oral , delayed-release mesalamine for 6 weeks in a low - ( 27-71 mg g ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) ) or high-dose group ( 53-118 mg g ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint was treatment success , defined as the proportion of patients who achieved remission ( PUCAI score < 10 ) or partial response ( PUCAI score 10 with a decrease from baseline by 20 points ) . METHODS	Secondary endpoints included truncated Mayo Score and global assessment of change of disease activity . RESULTS	The modified intent-to-treat population included 81 of 83 patients enrolled . RESULTS	Treatment success by PUCAI was achieved by 23 of 41 ( 56 % ) and 22 of 40 ( 55 % ) patients in the mesalamine low - and high-dose groups , respectively ( P = 0.924 ) . RESULTS	Truncated Mayo Score ( low-dose 30 [ 73 % ] and high-dose 28 [ 70 % ] patients ) and other efficacy results did not differ between the groups . RESULTS	The type and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported in previous studies of adults with ulcerative colitis and did not differ between groups . CONCLUSIONS	Both low - and high-dose oral , delayed-release mesalamine doses were equally effective as short-term treatment of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis in children , without a specific benefit or risk to using either dose ."
"BACKGROUND	Malnutrition is an independent risk factor of postoperative morbidity and mortality and it 's observed in 20 to 50 % of surgical patients . BACKGROUND	Preoperative interventions to optimize the nutritional status , reduce postoperative complications and enteral nutrition has proven to be superior to the parenteral one . BACKGROUND	Moreover , regardless of the nutritional status of the patient , surgery impairs the immunological response , thus increasing the risk of postoperative sepsis . BACKGROUND	Immunonutrition has been developed to improve the immunometabolic host response in perioperative period and it has been proven to reduce significantly postoperative infectious complications and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery for tumors . BACKGROUND	We hypothesize that a preoperative oral immunonutrition ( ORAL IMPACT ) can reduce postoperative morbidity in liver resection for cancer . METHODS	Prospective multicenter randomized placebo-controlled double-blind phase IV trial with two parallel treatment groups receiving either study product ( ORAL IMPACT ) or control supplement ( isocaloric isonitrogenous supplement -- IMPACT CONTROL ) for 7 days before liver resection for cancer . METHODS	A total of 400 patients will be enrolled . METHODS	Patients will be stratified according to the type of hepatectomy , the presence of chronic liver disease and the investigator center . METHODS	The main end-point is to evaluate in intention-to-treat analysis the overall 30-day morbidity . METHODS	Secondary end-points are to assess the 30-day infectious and non-infectious morbidity , length of antibiotic treatment and hospital stay , modifications on total food intake , compliance to treatment , side-effects of immunonutrition , impact on liver regeneration and sarcopenia , and to perform a medico-economic analysis . CONCLUSIONS	The overall morbidity rate after liver resection is 22 % to 42 % . CONCLUSIONS	Infectious post-operative complications ( 12 % to 23 % ) increase the length of hospital stay and costs and are responsible for a quarter of 30-day mortality . CONCLUSIONS	Various methods have been advocated to decrease the rate of postoperative complications but there is no evidence to support or refute the use of any treatment and further trials are required . CONCLUSIONS	The effects of preoperative oral immunonutrition in non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection for cancer are unknown . CONCLUSIONS	The present trial is designed to evaluate whether the administration of a short-term preoperative oral immunonutrition can reduce postoperative morbidity in non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection for cancer . BACKGROUND	Clinicaltrial.gov : NCT02041871 ."
"BACKGROUND	Minocycline and lymecycline are used in the treatment of acne , but there is not enough evidence to support superior efficacy of one of them . METHODS	170 participants from 14 to 34 years old with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris were recruited . METHODS	84 had 100 mg of minocycline in a single daily dose for 8 weeks and 86 had 300 mg of lymecycline in a single daily dose for 8 weeks . METHODS	Participants were evaluated at baseline , week 4 and week 8 . RESULTS	65 minocycline and 60 lymecycline patients were evaluable . RESULTS	The last observation carried forward for the count of non-inflammatory lesions changed from 37.5 17.8 to 37.7 17.8 in the minocycline group and from 36.9 15.5 to 33.4 19.3 in the lymecycline group ( no significant changes ) ; corresponding changes in inflammatory lesions were from 19.4 12.4 to 12.2 10.0 in the minocycline group and from 20.1 11.3 to 12.6 8.4 in lymecycline group ( P < 0.05 comparing baseline vs. final in both groups ) . RESULTS	Porphyrin counts varied from 899.5 613.9 to 233.5 219.5 in the minocycline group and from 956.9 661.8 to 411.8 411.5 in the lymecycline group ( P < 0.05 between the groups at study end ) . RESULTS	36 ( 42.9 % ) patients receiving minocycline suffered 55 adverse events ( 22 of them gastrointestinal ) , while 28 ( 33.3 % ) lymecycline patients had 37 adverse events ( 15 of them gastrointestinal ) . RESULTS	One patient in the lymecycline group withdrew the study due to gastritis , and one more patient in the same group experienced eosinophilia . CONCLUSIONS	There were no differences between the groups in non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts , and in the safety profile . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with minocycline induced statistically significant decrease in facial porphyrin counts compared to the group treated with lymecycline ( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00988026 ) ."
"OBJECTIVE	The effectiveness and tolerability of tapentadol extended release ( ER ) , a centrally acting analgesic with - opioid receptor agonist and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) reuptake inhibitor activities , have been demonstrated in patients with chronic pain , including those switching directly from prior opioid therapy . OBJECTIVE	The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conversion to oral tapentadol ER ( 50-250 mg twice daily ) from previous around-the-clock strong opioid therapy in patients with moderate to severe , chronic malignant tumor-related cancer pain that was well-controlled . METHODS	This randomized , open-label , phase III study , which was conducted in Japan , included a 1 - to 2-week screening period ( on previous opioid ) and an 8-week , open-label treatment period . METHODS	Eligible patients , who were taking a strong opioid analgesic and had a mean pain intensity score < 4 during the 3 days prior to randomization ( adequate pain control on previous strong opioid ) , were randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive twice-daily treatment with tapentadol ER ( 100-500 mg/day ) or morphine sustained release ( SR ; 20-140 mg/day ; reference for assay sensitivity ) . METHODS	Initial doses were estimated based on the conversion ratio of tapentadol ER : oxycodone : morphine : fentanyl = 10:2:3:0.03 . METHODS	The primary effectiveness endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained pain control [ change from baseline in mean pain intensity ( 11-point numerical rating scale ) less than +1.5 for 3 consecutive days and no more than two doses of rescue medication per day for 3 consecutive days ) during the first week of open-label treatment . RESULTS	In the tapentadol ER group ( n = 50 ) , 84.0 % of patients ( 42/50 ; 95 % CI , 70.89-92 .83 ) maintained pain control during Week 1 . RESULTS	On the Patient Global Impression of Change , 2.1 % ( 1/48 ) , 2.1 % ( 1/48 ) , 22.9 % ( 11/48 ) , and 50.0 % ( 24/48 ) of patients in the tapentadol ER group reported that their overall condition was `` very much improved , '' `` much improved , '' `` minimally improved , '' and `` not changed , '' respectively , at Week 1 compared with 0 % , 10.7 % ( 3/28 ) , 28.6 % ( 8/28 ) , and 53.6 % ( 15/28 ) reporting these ratings at Week 8 . RESULTS	The sensitivity of effectiveness analyses was validated based on results using morphine SR ; 98.0 % ( 49/50 ; 95 % CI , 89.35-99 .95 ) of patients in the morphine SR group maintained pain control after 1 week of treatment . RESULTS	The overall safety profile was similar to that demonstrated in previous studies ; tapentadol ER was associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal treatment-emergent adverse events than morphine SR [ 38.0 % ( 19/50 ) vs. 54.0 % ( 27/50 ) ] , including constipation [ 12.0 % ( 6/50 ) vs. 20.0 % ( 10/50 ) ] and vomiting [ 6.0 % ( 3/50 ) vs. 26.0 % ( 13/50 ) ] . CONCLUSIONS	Overall , results indicate that conversion from previous strong opioids to tapentadol ER ( 50-250 mg twice daily ) was successful and resulted in safe and effective pain control with improved gastrointestinal tolerability versus morphine SR in patients with moderate to severe cancer-related pain that was well-controlled on their previous opioid ."
"OBJECTIVE	There is no consensus as to which bariatric procedure is preferred to reduce weight and improve health in patients with a body mass index higher than 50 . OBJECTIVE	To compare 5-year outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( gastric bypass ) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch ( duodenal switch ) . METHODS	Randomized clinical open-label trial at Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway , and Sahlgrenska University Hospital , Gothenburg , Sweden . METHODS	Participants were recruited between March 17 , 2006 , and August 20 , 2007 , and included 60 patients aged 20 to 50 years with a body mass index of 50 to 60 . METHODS	The current study provides the 5-year follow-up analyses by intent to treat , excluding one participant accepted for inclusion who declined being operated on prior to knowing to what group he was randomized . METHODS	Laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic duodenal switch . METHODS	Body mass index and secondary outcomes including anthropometric measures , cardiometabolic risk factors , pulmonary function , vitamin status , gastrointestinal symptoms , health-related quality of life , and adverse events . RESULTS	Sixty patients were randomly assigned and operated on with gastric bypass ( n = 31 ) and duodenal switch ( n = 29 ) . RESULTS	Fifty-five patients ( 92 % ) completed the study . RESULTS	Five years after surgery , the mean reductions in body mass index were 13.6 ( 95 % CI , 11.0-16 .1 ) and 22.1 ( 95 % CI , 19.5-24 .7 ) after gastric bypass and duodenal switch , respectively . RESULTS	The mean between-group difference was 8.5 ( 95 % CI , 4.9-12 .2 ; P < .001 ) . RESULTS	Remission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and changes in blood pressure and lung function were similar between groups . RESULTS	Reductions in total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides , and fasting glucose were significantly greater after duodenal switch compared with gastric bypass . RESULTS	Serum concentrations of vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly reduced after duodenal switch compared with gastric bypass . RESULTS	Duodenal switch was associated with more gastrointestinal adverse effects . RESULTS	Health-related quality of life was similar between groups . RESULTS	Patients with duodenal switch underwent more surgical procedures related to the initial procedure ( 13 [ 44.8 % ] vs 3 [ 9.7 % ] patients ; P = .002 ) and had significantly more hospital admissions compared with patients with gastric bypass . CONCLUSIONS	In patients with a body mass index of 50 to 60 , duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss and greater improvements in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglyceride , and glucose levels 5 years after surgery compared with gastric bypass while improvements in health-related quality of life were similar . CONCLUSIONS	However , duodenal switch was associated with more surgical , nutritional , and gastrointestinal adverse effects . BACKGROUND	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00327912 ."
"BACKGROUND	Although gastrointestinal ( GI ) , respiratory , and dermal symptoms are common , few studies have conducted concurrent and comparative prospective analyses of risk factors for these 3 morbidity outcomes . METHODS	We used data from a community-based randomized controlled trial among 277 South Australian families to analyze GI ( diarrhea , vomiting ) , respiratory ( sore throat , runny nose , cough ) and dermal ( rash , generalized itch , dermal infection ) symptoms . RESULTS	Log-binomial regression analysis revealed similar risks of GI ( adjusted risk ratio [ RR ] , 1.65 ; 95 % CI , 1.05-2 .58 ) and respiratory ( RR , 1.68 ; 95 % CI , 1.31-2 .15 ) symptoms among childcare/kindergarten attendees . RESULTS	Swimming in public pools/spas in the current or previous week was associated with all 3 symptom complexes , conferring similar risk for each ( RR for GI : 1.33 ; 95 % CI , 0.99-1 .77 ; respiratory : 1.20 ; 95 % CI , 1.04-1 .38 ; dermal : 1.41 ; 95 % CI , 1.08-1 .85 ) . RESULTS	Pet ownership was not associated with symptoms . RESULTS	Household clustering of GI and respiratory symptoms was common , and clustering of respiratory symptoms correlated with number of individuals per household . CONCLUSIONS	This simultaneous examination of risk factors for 3 health outcomes yielded new comparative data that are useful for developing prevention strategies ."
"OBJECTIVE	Fructose consumption has risen alongside obesity and diabetes . OBJECTIVE	Gut hormones involved in hunger and satiety ( ghrelin and PYY ) may respond differently to fructose compared with glucose ingestion . OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the effects of glucose and fructose ingestion on ghrelin and PYY in lean and obese adolescents with differing insulin sensitivity . METHODS	Adolescents were divided into lean ( n = 14 ) , obese insulin sensitive ( n = 12 ) ( OIS ) , and obese insulin resistant ( n = 15 ) ( OIR ) . METHODS	In a double-blind , cross-over design , subjects drank 75 g of glucose or fructose in random order , serum was obtained every 10 minutes for 60 minutes . RESULTS	Baseline acyl-ghrelin was highest in lean and lowest in OIR ( P = 0.02 ) . RESULTS	After glucose ingestion , acyl-ghrelin decreased similarly in lean and OIS but was lower in OIR ( vs. lean , P = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	Suppression differences were more pronounced after fructose ( lean vs. OIS , P = 0.008 , lean vs. OIR , P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	OIS became significantly hungrier after fructose ( P = 0.015 ) . RESULTS	PYY was not significantly different at baseline , varied minimally after glucose , and rose after fructose . CONCLUSIONS	Compared with lean , OIS adolescents have impaired acyl-ghrelin responses to fructose but not glucose , whereas OIR adolescents have blunted responses to both . CONCLUSIONS	Diminished suppression of acyl-ghrelin in childhood obesity , particularly if accompanied by insulin resistance , may promote hunger and overeating ."
"OBJECTIVE	X-linked retinitis pigmentosa is a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease with a frequency of 1 in 100,000 persons . OBJECTIVE	Because no cure is available for this orphan disease and treatment options are limited , slowing of disease progression would be a meaningful outcome . OBJECTIVE	To determine whether high-dose docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , an -3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , slows progression of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa measured by cone electroretinography ( ERG ) . METHODS	A 4-year , single-site , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-masked phase 2 clinical trial at a research center specializing in medical retina . METHODS	Seventy-eight male patients diagnosed as having X-linked retinitis pigmentosa were randomized to DHA or placebo . METHODS	Data were omitted for 2 patients with non-X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and 16 patients who were unable to follow protocol during the first year . METHODS	The remaining participants were tested annually and composed a modified intent-to-treat cohort ( DHA group , n = 33 ; placebo group , n = 27 ) . METHODS	All participants received a multivitamin and were randomly assigned to oral DHA ( 30 mg/kg/d ) or placebo . METHODS	The primary outcome was the rate of loss of cone ERG function . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were rod and maximal ERG amplitudes and cone ERG implicit times . METHODS	Capsule counts and red blood cell DHA levels were assessed to monitor adherence . RESULTS	Average ( 6-month to 4-year ) red blood cell DHA levels were 4-fold higher in the DHA group than in the placebo group ( P < .001 ) . RESULTS	There was no difference between the DHA and placebo groups in the rate of cone ERG functional loss ( 0.028 vs 0.022 log V/y , respectively ; P = .30 ) . RESULTS	No group differences were evident for change in rod ERG ( P = .27 ) , maximal ERG ( P = .65 ) , or cone implicit time ( no change over 4 years ) . RESULTS	The rate of cone loss ( ie , event rate ) was markedly reduced compared with rates in previous studies . RESULTS	No severe treatment-emergent adverse events were found . CONCLUSIONS	Long-term DHA supplementation was not effective in slowing the loss of cone or rod ERG function associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa . CONCLUSIONS	Participant dropout and lower-than-expected disease event rate limited power to detect statistical significance . CONCLUSIONS	A larger sample size , longer trial , and attainment of a target blood DHA level ( 13 % ) would be desirable . CONCLUSIONS	While DHA supplementation at 30 mg/kg/d does not present serious adverse effects , routine monitoring of gastrointestinal tolerance is prudent .

"BACKGROUND	Recent studies indicate that persistent intestinal inflammation in patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) might be caused by abnormal intestinal microbiota . BACKGROUND	This hypothesis may suggest a beneficial effect of antibiotics in CD therapy . BACKGROUND	So far , guidelines do not recommend antibiotics except in the treatment of complicated CD , and there are few studies on the effects of rifaximin in these patients . METHODS	Between December 2011 and December 2012 , we performed a blinded randomized trial in 168 patients with a previous history of moderately active CD concerning the efficacy of rifaximin . METHODS	All the patients had previously achieved remission with standard therapy ( prednisone/budesonide ) . METHODS	Data from patients receiving 800 mg of rifaximin ( 83 patients ) twice a day for 12 weeks were compared with those from patients who received placebo ( 83 patients ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint was maintaining remission during the follow-up . RESULTS	All the patients ( 100 % ; 83/83 ) on 800 mg of rifaximin were in remission after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison with 84 % ( 70/83 ) of the placebo group . RESULTS	This significant difference was also persistent at the 24-week follow-up [ 78 % ( 65/83 ) vs. 41 % ( 34/83 ) , respectively ] . RESULTS	The last evaluation performed at 48 weeks revealed disease activity in 45 % ( 38/83 ) of the patients of the rifaximin group , i.e. a significant decrease compared with the placebo group [ 75 % ( 63 of 83 ) ] . CONCLUSIONS	Remission previously obtained with standard treatment can be sustained in patients with moderately active CD after the administration of 800 mg of rifaximin ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare post-operative long-term complications and quality of life of two digestive reconstruction procedures after total gastrectomy . METHODS	A total of 109 gastric cancer patients in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital from March 2012 to February 2013 were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into functional jejunal interposition ( FJI ) group ( 52 cases ) and Roux-en-Y ( R-Y ) group ( 57 cases ) . METHODS	The post-operative complications , nutritional status , and the quality of life were compared between two groups . RESULTS	One , 3 and 6 months after operation , the incidence of R-S syndrome in FJI group was lower as compared to R-Y group [ 13 % ( 6/45 ) vs. 37 % ( 18/49 ) , 3 % ( 1/30 ) vs. 42 % ( 14/33 ) , 5 % ( 1/21 ) vs. 48 % ( 11/23 ) , all P < 0.01 ] , while 3 months after operation , the incidence of reflux and heartburn in FJI group was higher [ 53 % ( 16/30 ) vs. 21 % ( 7/33 ) , P < 0.01 ; 37 % ( 11/30 ) vs. 12 % ( 4/33 ) , P < 0.05 ] . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 between R-Y and FJI groups . RESULTS	QLQ-STO22 stomach module revealed in FJI group , the eating score was better , but reflux score was worse as compared to R-Y group 3 months after operation ( all P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Functional jejunal interposition keeps intestinal continuity preserving and food duodenal passing , which is a reasonable digestive reconstruction procedure ."
"METHODS	Scarce data are available concerning effects of certain bioactive substances such as Maillard reaction products ( MRP ) on the gut microbiota composition , and the question of how a diet rich in MRP affects gut microbiota in humans is still open . RESULTS	Two experiments were conducted . RESULTS	In expt . RESULTS	1 , adolescents consumed diets either high or low in MRP in a two-period crossover trial ; in expt . RESULTS	2 , rats were fed diets supplemented or not with MRP model-systems . RESULTS	Intestinal microbiota composition in fecal ( adolescents ) or cecal ( rat ) samples was assessed by qPCR analysis . RESULTS	Negative correlations were found in the human assay between lactobacilli numbers and dietary advanced MRP ( r = -0.418 and -0.387 , for hydroxymethylfurfural and carboxymethyl-lysine respectively , p < 0.05 ) , whereas bifidobacteria counts were negatively correlated with Amadori compounds intake . RESULTS	In the rat assay , total bacteria and lactobacilli were negatively correlated with MRP intake ( r = -0.674 , -0.675 and -0.676 , for Amadori compounds , hydroxymethylfurfural and carboxymethyl-lysine respectively , p < 0.05 ) , but no correlations were found with bifidobacteria . CONCLUSIONS	Dietary MRP are able to modulate in vivo the intestinal microbiota composition both in humans and in rats , and the specific effects are likely to be linked to the chemical structure and dietary amounts of the different browning compounds ."
"OBJECTIVE	Prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between whole grain consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes , where short chain fatty acids ( SCFA ) may be involved . OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to determine the effect of isolated arabinoxylan alone or in combination with whole grain rye kernels on postprandial glucose , insulin , free fatty acids ( FFA ) , gut hormones , SCFA and appetite in subjects with the metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . METHODS	Fifteen subjects with MetS participated in this acute , randomised , cross-over study . METHODS	The test meals each providing 50g of digestible carbohydrate were as follows : semolina porridge added concentrated arabinoxylan ( AX ) , rye kernels ( RK ) or concentrated arabinoxylan combined with rye kernels ( AXRK ) and semolina porridge as control ( SE ) . METHODS	A standard lunch was served 4h after the test meals . METHODS	Blood samples were drawn during a 6-h period , and appetite scores and breath hydrogen were assessed every 30min . RESULTS	The AXRK meal reduced the acute glucose ( P = 0.005 ) and insulin responses ( P < 0.001 ) and the feeling of hunger ( P = 0.005 ; 0-360min ) compared with the control meal . RESULTS	The AX and AXRK meals increased butyrate and acetate concentrations after 6h . RESULTS	No significant differences were found for the second meal responses of glucose , insulin , FFA , glucagon-like peptide-1 or ghrelin . CONCLUSIONS	Our results indicate a stimulatory effect of arabinoxylan on butyrate and acetate production , however , with no detectable effect on the second meal glucose response . CONCLUSIONS	It remains to be tested in a long-term study if a beneficial effect on the glucose response of the isolated arabinoxylan will be related to the SCFA production ."
"OBJECTIVE	To explore and detail clinical experiences of dabigatran , a novel anticoagulant , after it became available in New Zealand in July 2011 . METHODS	A cohort of patients was recruited from Hutt Hospital and the two largest primary care practices in the Hutt Valley region . METHODS	They were included if they took at least one dose of dabigatran between July 2011 and April 2012 . METHODS	Participants undertook a questionnaire 3-12 months after starting dabigatran assessing adherence , perceived side-effects and complications . METHODS	Those presenting due to an adverse event were analysed separately . RESULTS	Of 102 patients identified , 92 were recruited to this study . RESULTS	At a median of 8 months , 70 % of participants were still taking dabigatran , significantly lower than in the RE-LY trial at 12 months ( P = 0.0002 ) . RESULTS	The commonest reason given for discontinuation was gastrointestinal ( GI ) side-effects . RESULTS	Rates of serious adverse outcomes on dabigatran therapy were relatively low . RESULTS	Patients expressed polarised comments , both positive and negative , regarding their experiences of dabigatran . CONCLUSIONS	A high rate of discontinuation of dabigatran , mainly due to GI symptoms , was observed . CONCLUSIONS	There does not appear to be any specific predictor of dabigatran tolerance . CONCLUSIONS	When prescribed according to guidelines , rates of serious adverse events associated with dabigatran appear to be low ."
"OBJECTIVE	To determine effects of probiotic consumption on clinical and immunological parameters of seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) in an out-of-season single nasal allergen challenge . METHODS	In a study registered at ClinicalTrials.Gov ( NCT01123252 ) , a 16-week dietary intervention was undertaken in 60 patients with allergic rhinitis ( > 16 years old ) . METHODS	Using a double-blinded , placebo-controlled anonymised design , the patients were divided equally into two groups . METHODS	One group was given a dairy drink containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota to ingest daily while the other consumed a similar drink without bacteria . METHODS	Participants attended the clinic on two consecutive days before the intervention and then again at the end of the study period . METHODS	On the first day of each 2-day visit , following clinical examination , assessments were made of total nasal symptoms scores and peak nasal inspiratory flow . METHODS	Nasal scrapings , nasal lavage and blood were collected for laboratory analyses of cellular phenotypes , soluble mediator release and in vitro responses to pollen allergen . METHODS	These procedures were repeated 24 hours following nasal allergen challenge . RESULTS	Prior to and following intervention there were no detectable differences between study groups in measured clinical outcome . RESULTS	After intervention , there were differences between groups in their percentages of CD86 + epithelial cells ( p = 0.0148 ) , CD86 + CD252 + non-epithelial cells ( p = 0.0347 ) , sIL-1RII release ( p = 0.0289 ) and IL-1 ( p = 0.0224 ) levels at the nasal mucosa . RESULTS	Delivery of probiotic also suppressed production of sCD23 ( p = 0.0081 ) , TGF - ( p = 0.0283 ) and induced increased production of IFN - ( p = 0.0351 ) in supernatants of cultured peripheral blood . CONCLUSIONS	This study did not show significant probiotic-associated changes with respect to the primary clinical endpoint . CONCLUSIONS	An absence of overt clinical benefit may be due to an inability of single nasal challenges to accurately represent natural allergen exposure . CONCLUSIONS	Nevertheless , oral delivery of probiotics produced changes of the immunological microenvironment at the nasal mucosa in individuals affected by SAR . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.Gov NCT01123252 ."
"OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of EMD 525797 ( DI17E6 ) , a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting v-integrins , in healthy subjects . METHODS	In this first-in-human , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized Phase 1 study , healthy male volunteers were consecutively assigned to 6 ascending single-dose cohorts of 35 , 100 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , or 1500 mg . METHODS	Per dose cohort , EMD 525797 or placebo was administered over 1 h as an intravenous 250-mL infusion to 6 and 3 volunteers , respectively . METHODS	Escalation to the next dose level was based on evaluation of safety , tolerability , and PK data . RESULTS	Fifty-five subjects ( aged 18-45 years ) were randomized . RESULTS	Twenty-seven of 37 ( 73 % ) subjects receiving EMD 525797 reported a total of 61 adverse events ( AEs ) , including 38 events ( in 17 subjects ) considered by the investigator to be treatment related . RESULTS	A total of 35 AEs were reported by 14 of 18 ( 78 % ) placebo-treated subjects . RESULTS	The most commonly occurring AEs were gastrointestinal disorders , abnormal laboratory values , and increased or decreased biochemistry and/or hematology values , as well as headaches , which occurred at a slightly higher frequency in the EMD 525797 group compared with placebo . RESULTS	There were no serious AEs or deaths . RESULTS	EMD 525797 PK appeared to be dose dependent , especially at lower doses .

"BACKGROUND	Tacrolimus is an established immunosuppressant used for the prevention and treatment of allograft rejection in solid organ transplantation . BACKGROUND	An immediate-release oral formulation of tacrolimus has been commercially available since 1994 that is administered orally BID . BACKGROUND	To improve the compliance and quality of life of transplant patients , a once-daily modified release ( MR ) formulation is an attractive option . BACKGROUND	However , to be successful , the drug of interest must be sufficiently well absorbed from the distal region of the gastrointestinal tract . OBJECTIVE	To facilitate the development of an MR formulation , we investigated the absorption of tacrolimus from different regions of the human gastrointestinal tract , proximal and distal small bowels , and ascending colon . METHODS	The study was performed as an open-label , randomized , 4-way crossover design in 6 healthy white male subjects . METHODS	For each subject , 1 mg ( 2 mg/mL ) of tacrolimus solution in polyethylene glycol 400 was administered to each location in the gastrointestinal tract via a site-specific radiolabeled delivery capsule , which can release tacrolimus solution at specific sites of the gastrointestinal tract . METHODS	Real-time visualization of capsule location and tacrolimus release at each target site was performed by using - scintigraphy . METHODS	Blood samples were collected to determine tacrolimus levels in the blood . METHODS	The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax , Tmax after the capsule activation , AUC0-24 , and mean residence time were determined from the concentration-time profiles . RESULTS	Ten healthy male subjects underwent dosing . RESULTS	Six subjects completed all 4 treatments . RESULTS	Three adverse events ( mild headache [ n = 1 ] , small amount of blood in stool [ n = 1 ] , and mild syncopal episode [ n = 1 ] ) that were possibly study drug related were reported in 3 different subjects . RESULTS	Tacrolimus was absorbed from not only the small intestine but also from the colonic region of the gastrointestinal tract . RESULTS	Although AUC0-24 values revealed some site-specific absorption tendencies , the mean AUC0-24 values obtained were similar regardless of the location of tacrolimus release from the capsule . CONCLUSIONS	Tacrolimus was absorbed from the duodenum to the colon in these male subjects , although differences were observed in the value of AUC0-24 , possibly due to variation in cytochrome P450 3A4 activity in the intestine . CONCLUSIONS	Although this study was conducted in small group of healthy fasting men , the present results indicate that tacrolimus is suitable for MR formulation development due to a wide absorption window throughout the intestine in humans ."
"BACKGROUND	Exercise and diet are the cornerstones for the treatment of obesity in obese children and adolescents . BACKGROUND	However , compensatory changes in appetite and energy expenditure elicited by exercise and dieting make it hard to maintain a reduced weight over the longterm . BACKGROUND	The anorexic effect of hypoxia can be potentially utilized to counteract this compensatory increase , thereby enhancing the success of weight loss . BACKGROUND	The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of four week intermittent hypoxia exposure added to a traditional exercise and diet intervention on inducing short - and longterm weight loss in obese adolescents . METHODS	In this randomized parallel group controlled clinical trial , 40 obese adolescents ( 20 boys and 20 girls , 11 to 15-years-old ) , will be recruited from a summer weight loss camp at the Shanghai University of Sport , China . METHODS	Participants will be stratified by gender and randomly assigned to either the control group or the hypoxia group . METHODS	During the four-week intervention period , both groups will exercise and eat a balanced diet . METHODS	Additionally , the control group will sleep in normal conditions , while the hypoxia group will sleep in a normobaric hypoxia chamber ( sleep high and train low ) . METHODS	The primary outcome will be body composition and the main secondary outcomes will be the circulating levels of appetite regulatory gastrointestinal hormones . METHODS	All the outcome measures will be assessed at baseline , after the four-week intervention , and at two months follow-up . CONCLUSIONS	Our study will be the first to evaluate the effectiveness of ` sleep high and train low ' on short - and longterm weight loss among obese adolescents . CONCLUSIONS	A potential mechanism for the appetite regulatory effect of hypoxia will also be explored . CONCLUSIONS	The results of the study will provide an evidence-based recommendation for the use of hypoxia in a weight loss intervention among obese children and adolescents . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , the clarification of mechanisms leading to weight loss in ` sleep high and train low ' might provide information for the development of new strategies in combating obesity . BACKGROUND	This trial was registered on 10 January 2014 at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with the registration number : ChiCTR-TRC-14004106 ."
"BACKGROUND	The conventional sequence when using supraglottic airway devices is insertion , cuff inflation and fixation . BACKGROUND	Our hypothesis was that a tighter fit of the cuff and tip could be achieved with a consequently lower incidence of air leak , better separation of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and less airway morbidity if the device were first affixed and the cuff then inflated . METHODS	Our clinical review board approved the study ( public registry number DRKS00003174 ) . METHODS	An LMA Supreme was inserted into 184 patients undergoing lower limb arthroscopy in propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia who were randomly assigned to either the control ( inflation then fixation ; n = 92 ) or study group ( fixation then inflation ; n = 92 ) . METHODS	The cuff was inflated to 60 cmH2O . METHODS	The patients ' lungs were ventilated in pressure-controlled mode with 5 cmH2O PEEP , Pmax to give 6mlkg-1 tidal volume , and respiratory rate adjusted to end-tidal CO2 of 4.8 and 5.6 kPa . METHODS	Correct cuff and tip position were determined by leak detection , capnometry trace , oropharyngeal leak pressure , suprasternal notch test , and lube-tube test . METHODS	Bowl and cuff position and the presence of glottic narrowing were assessed by fiberscopic examination . METHODS	Postoperative dysphagia , hoarseness and sore throat were assessed with a questionnaire . METHODS	Ventilatory impairment was defined as a tidal volume < 6mlkg-1 with Pmax at oropharyngeal leak pressure , glottic narrowing was defined as an angle between the vocal cords under 16 degrees . RESULTS	The incidence of incorrect device position ( 18 % vs. 21 % ) , failed ventilation ( 10 % vs. 9 % ) , leak pressure ( 24.8 vs. 25.2 cmH2O , p = 0.63 ) , failed lube-tube test ( 16.3 % vs. 17.6 % ) and glottic narrowing ( 19.3 % vs. 14.1 % , p = 0.35 ) was similar in both groups ( control vs. study , resp . ) RESULTS	When glottic narrowing occurred , it was more frequently associated with ventilatory impairment in the control group ( 77 % vs. 39 % ; p = 0.04 ) . RESULTS	Airway morbidity was more common in the control group ( 33 % vs. 19 % ; p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Altering the sequence of cuff inflation and device fixation does not affect device position , oropharyngeal leak pressures or separation of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts . CONCLUSIONS	It reduces the incidence of glottic narrowing with impaired ventilation and also perioperative airway morbidity ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of pancreatic duct stent internal versus external drainage with pancreaticojejunostomy on the early curative effect after pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) . METHODS	The study was a prospective controlled trial . METHODS	A total of 219 patients undergoing PD from January 2010 to March 2013 were randomly divided into external drainage group ( n = 110 ) and internal drainage group ( n = 109 ) . METHODS	The pancreatic duct stent was put in the jejunum during the operation in the internal drainage group , while that in the external drainage group was placed outside the body through the jejunum and abdominal wall . METHODS	The intra-operative blood loss , operative duration , post-operative hospital stay , mortality rate , and the morbidity of pancreatic fistula as well as other complications were compared between the two groups . RESULTS	Compared with internal drainage group , pancreatic duct stent external drainage obviously reduced the morbidity of pancreatic fistula ( 13.6 % vs. 22.6 % ) , delayed gastric emptying ( 10.0 % vs. 27.5 % ) , abdominal infection ( 6.4 % vs. 19.3 % ) , intestinal obstruction ( 8.2 % vs. 20.2 % ) along with the overall complications ( 24.5 % vs. 41.3 % ) after PD ( ( 2 ) = 5.735 8 to 11.047 7 , P < 0.05 ) , and shortened the healing duration of pancreatic fistula ( ( 11.5 2.9 ) d vs. ( 20.1 5.7 ) d , t = 5.07 , P < 0.01 ) , while there was no significant difference in the intra-operative blood loss , operative duration , post-operative hospital stay and mortality rate , etc between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Pancreatic duct stent external drainage can effectively reduce the morbidity of pancreatic fistula and the overall complications after PD , which is safe and feasible . CONCLUSIONS	The method is worthy of popularization and application clinically ."
"OBJECTIVE	To show that albiglutide , a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist , is an effective and generally safe treatment to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose hyperglycaemia is inadequately controlled with pioglitazone ( with or without metformin ) . METHODS	In this 3-year , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , 310 adult patients on a regimen of pioglitazone ( with or without metformin ) were randomly assigned to receive additional treatment with albiglutide [ 30 mg subcutaneous ( s.c. ) once weekly , n = 155 ] or matching placebo ( n = 155 ) . METHODS	The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 52 ( intention-to-treat ) in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . RESULTS	The model-adjusted change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52 was significantly better with albiglutide than with placebo ( -0.8 % , 95 % confidence interval -1.0 , -0.6 ; p < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Change from baseline fasting plasma glucose was -1.3 mmol/l in the albiglutide group and +0.4 mmol/l in the placebo group ( p < 0.0001 ) ; a significantly higher percentage of patients reached the HbA1c goals with albiglutide ( p < 0.0001 ) , and the rate of hyperglycaemia rescue up to week 52 for albiglutide was 24.4 versus 47.7 % for placebo ( p < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Albiglutide plus pioglitazone had no impact on weight , and severe hypoglycaemia was observed rarely ( n = 2 ) . RESULTS	With few exceptions , the results of safety assessments were similar between the groups , and most adverse events ( AEs ) were mild or moderate . RESULTS	The 52-week incidence rates for gastrointestinal AEs for albiglutide and placebo were : 31.3 and 29.8 % , respectively ( diarrhoea : 11.3 and 8.6 % ; nausea : 10.7 and 11.3 % ; vomiting : 4.0 and 4.0 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	Albiglutide 30 mg administered once weekly as an add-on to pioglitazone ( with or without metformin ) provided effective and durable glucose lowering and was generally well tolerated ."
"OBJECTIVE	No therapy directed against diabetes has been shown to unequivocally reduce the excess risk of cardiovascular complications . OBJECTIVE	Aleglitazar is a dual agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors with insulin-sensitizing and glucose-lowering actions and favorable effects on lipid profiles . OBJECTIVE	To determine whether the addition of aleglitazar to standard medical therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . METHODS	AleCardio was a phase 3 , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 720 hospitals in 26 countries throughout North America , Latin America , Europe , and Asia-Pacific regions . METHODS	The enrollment of 7226 patients hospitalized for ACS ( myocardial infarction or unstable angina ) with type 2 diabetes occurred between February 2010 and May 2012 ; treatment was planned to continue until patients were followed-up for at least 2.5 years and 950 primary end point events were positively adjudicated . METHODS	Randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive aleglitazar 150 g or placebo daily . METHODS	The primary efficacy end point was time to cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , or nonfatal stroke . METHODS	Principal safety end points were hospitalization due to heart failure and changes in renal function . RESULTS	The trial was terminated on July 2 , 2013 , after a median follow-up of 104 weeks , upon recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board due to futility for efficacy at an unplanned interim analysis and increased rates of safety end points . RESULTS	A total of 3.1 % of patients were lost to follow-up and 3.2 % of patients withdrew consent . RESULTS	The primary end point occurred in 344 patients ( 9.5 % ) in the aleglitazar group and 360 patients ( 10.0 % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.96 [ 95 % CI , 0.83-1 .11 ] ; P = .57 ) . RESULTS	Rates of serious adverse events , including heart failure ( 3.4 % for aleglitazar vs 2.8 % for placebo , P = .14 ) , gastrointestinal hemorrhages ( 2.4 % for aleglitazar vs 1.7 % for placebo , P = .03 ) , and renal dysfunction ( 7.4 % for aleglitazar vs 2.7 % for placebo , P < .001 ) were increased . CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with type 2 diabetes and recent ACS , use of aleglitazar did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes . CONCLUSIONS	These findings do not support the use of aleglitazar in this setting with a goal of reducing cardiovascular risk . BACKGROUND	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT01042769 ."
"BACKGROUND	Foods that are high in dietary fiber can promote satiety , but previous studies report conflicting results . OBJECTIVE	The objective was to determine differences in satiety response to three conditions ( 10g oat bran , 10g barley bran and a low fiber condition ) consumed at dinner and breakfast . OBJECTIVE	In addition , we compared energy intake at an ad libitum lunch after consumption of the breakfast bars . METHODS	Randomized , double-blind crossover study . METHODS	42 normal weight women . METHODS	Women consumed a dinner food bar from one of the three conditions the evening before testing . METHODS	On test mornings , fasted women consumed the corresponding breakfast food bar with their choice of coffee , tea or water . METHODS	An ad libitum pizza lunch was served 4 hours after breakfast . METHODS	Visual analogue scales ( VAS ) were used to assess satiety at baseline , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 and 240 minutes . METHODS	Energy intake was assessed by an ad libitum pizza lunch ( 4 hours after breakfast ) and 24-hour energy intake was measured by a food diary . METHODS	Treatments were compared using the mixed-effects linear models . METHODS	Outcomes are reported as mean SEM . RESULTS	There were no significant differences among conditions on any of the satiety scales and no significant differences among conditions in energy consumed at lunch or over 24 hours . RESULTS	The fiber bars were well tolerated and no significant differences were found for gastrointestinal tolerance . CONCLUSIONS	Our results do not support an effect of bran fibers on satiety above a low fiber control . CONCLUSIONS	We acknowledge results of this study may be intricately tied to the choice of a single pizza lunch , as other ad libitum meal options could have resulted in different outcomes ."
"BACKGROUND	Antithrombotic drugs , such as low-dose aspirin ( LDA ) and clopidogrel , can cause upper gastrointestinal complications . OBJECTIVE	The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a mucosal-protective agent , rebamipide , could prevent gastric mucosal injuries induced by LDA with or without clopidogrel in healthy subjects . METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was performed with 32 healthy male volunteers . METHODS	Subjects were randomly assigned to a 14-day course of one of the following regimens : group A , placebo ( tid ) + LDA ; group B , rebamipide ( 100 mg tid ) + LDA ( 100 mg once-daily ) ; group C , placebo + LDA + clopidogrel ( 75 mg once-daily ) ; or group D , rebamipide + LDA + clopidogrel . METHODS	The grade of gastric mucosal injuries was evaluated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy before and after dosing ( on day 0 and day 14 ) , and the grade of gastric mucosal injury was assessed according to the modified Lanza score . METHODS	Subjective symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) . METHODS	A rapid urease test was performed on day 0 , and blood tests were performed on day 0 and day 14 . RESULTS	Rebamipide significantly inhibited gastric mucosal injury induced by LDA alone or by LDA plus clopidogrel when compared with placebo in healthy subjects . RESULTS	GSRS score and hemoglobin level were not significantly different among the four groups . CONCLUSIONS	Rebamipide is useful for the primary prevention of gastric mucosal injury induced by LDA alone or by LDA plus clopidogrel in healthy subjects ."
"OBJECTIVE	To use a high-quality multicenter trial dataset to determine dose-volume effects for gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity following radiation therapy for prostate carcinoma . OBJECTIVE	Influential dose-volume histogram regions were to be determined as functions of dose , anatomical location , toxicity , and clinical endpoint . METHODS	Planning datasets for 754 participants in the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial were available , with Late Effects of Normal Tissues ( LENT ) Subjective , Objective , Management , and Analytic ( SOMA ) toxicity assessment to a median of 72 months . METHODS	A rank sum method was used to define dose-volume cut-points as near-continuous functions of dose to 3 GI anatomical regions , together with a comprehensive assessment of significance . METHODS	Univariate and multivariate ordinal regression was used to assess the importance of cut-points at each dose . RESULTS	Dose ranges providing significant cut-points tended to be consistent with those showing significant univariate regression odds-ratios ( representing the probability of a unitary increase in toxicity grade per percent relative volume ) . RESULTS	Ranges of significant cut-points for rectal bleeding validated previously published results . RESULTS	Separation of the lower GI anatomy into complete anorectum , rectum , and anal canal showed the impact of mid-low doses to the anal canal on urgency and tenesmus , completeness of evacuation and stool frequency , and mid-high doses to the anorectum on bleeding and stool frequency . RESULTS	Derived multivariate models emphasized the importance of the high-dose region of the anorectum and rectum for rectal bleeding and mid - to low-dose regions for diarrhea and urgency and tenesmus , and low-to-mid doses to the anal canal for stool frequency , diarrhea , evacuation , and bleeding . CONCLUSIONS	Results confirm anatomical dependence of specific GI toxicities . CONCLUSIONS	They provide an atlas summarizing dose-histogram effects and derived constraints as functions of anatomical region , dose , toxicity , and endpoint for informing future radiation therapy planning ."
"BACKGROUND	The modulation of gut microbiota is considered to be the first target to establish probiotic efficacy in a healthy population . OBJECTIVE	This study was conducted to determine the impact of a probiotic on the intestinal microbial ecology of healthy volunteers . METHODS	High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the fecal microbiota in healthy adults ( 23-55 y old ) of both sexes , before and after 4 wk of daily consumption of a capsule containing at least 24 billion viable Lactobacillus paracasei DG cells , according to a randomized , double-blind , crossover placebo-controlled design . RESULTS	Probiotic intake induced an increase in Proteobacteria ( P = 0.006 ) and in the Clostridiales genus Coprococcus ( P = 0.009 ) , whereas the Clostridiales genus Blautia ( P = 0.036 ) was decreased ; a trend of reduction was also observed for Anaerostipes ( P = 0.05 ) and Clostridium ( P = 0.06 ) . RESULTS	We also found that the probiotic effect depended on the initial butyrate concentration . RESULTS	In fact , participants with butyrate > 100 mmol/kg of wet feces had a mean butyrate reduction of 49 21 % and a concomitant decrease in the sum of 6 Clostridiales genera , namely Faecalibacterium , Blautia , Anaerostipes , Pseudobutyrivibrio , Clostridium , and Butyrivibrio ( P = 0.021 ) , after the probiotic intervention . RESULTS	In contrast , in participants with initial butyrate concentrations < 25 mmol/kg of wet feces , the probiotic contributed to a 329 255 % ( mean SD ) increment in butyrate concomitantly with an 55 % decrease in Ruminococcus ( P = 0.016 ) and a 150 % increase in an abundantly represented unclassified Bacteroidales genus ( P = 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The intake of L. paracasei DG increased the Blautia : Coprococcus ratio , which , according to the literature , can potentially confer a health benefit on the host . CONCLUSIONS	The probiotic impact on the microbiota and on short-chain fatty acids , however , seems to strictly depend on the initial characteristics of the intestinal microbial ecosystem . CONCLUSIONS	In particular , fecal butyrate concentrations could represent an important biomarker for identifying subjects who may benefit from probiotic treatment . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn as ISRCTN56945491 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders , conferring considerable individual , family , and community burden . OBJECTIVE	To date , treatments for MDD have been derived from the monoamine hypothesis , and there is a paucity of emerging antidepressants , especially with novel mechanisms of action and treatment targets . OBJECTIVE	N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) is a redox-active glutathione precursor that decreases inflammatory cytokines , modulates glutamate , promotes neurogenesis , and decreases apoptosis , all of which contribute to the neurobiology of depression . METHODS	Participants with a current episode of MDD diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria ( N = 252 ) were treated with NAC or placebo in addition to treatment as usual for 12 weeks and were followed to 16 weeks . METHODS	Data were collected between 2007 and 2011 . RESULTS	The omnibus interaction between group and visit for the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , the primary outcome measure , was not significant ( F , . RESULTS	= 1.98 , P = .067 ) , and the groups did not separate at week 12 ( t. = -1.12 , P = .265 ) . RESULTS	However , at week 12 , the scores on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation-Range of Impaired Functioning Tool ( LIFE-RIFT ) differed from placebo ( P = .03 ) . RESULTS	Among participants with a MADRS score 25 , NAC separated from placebo at weeks 6 , 8 , 12 , and 16 ( P < .05 ) . RESULTS	Additionally , the rate of change between baseline and week 16 was significant ( t. = -2.11 , P = .036 ) . RESULTS	NAC treatment was superior to placebo at week 16 for secondary readouts of function and clinical impression . RESULTS	Remission and response were greater in the NAC group at week 16 , but not at week 12 . RESULTS	The NAC group had a greater rate of gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal adverse events . CONCLUSIONS	Being negative at the week 12 end point , and with some positive secondary signals , the study provides only limited support for the role of NAC as a novel adjunctive therapy for MDD . CONCLUSIONS	These data implicate the pathways influenced by NAC in depression pathogenesis , principally oxidative and inflammatory stress and glutamate , although definitive confirmation remains necessary .

"BACKGROUND	Existing anthelmintic drugs ( eg , albendazole and mebendazole ) have low efficacy against the intestinal nematode species Trichuris trichiura and the drug pipeline is exhausted . BACKGROUND	We aimed to investigate the strategy of combination chemotherapy with existing drugs to establish whether their efficacy could be enhanced and broadened . METHODS	In this randomised controlled trial , we compared three drug combinations and one standard drug alone in children aged 6-14 years in two schools on Pemba Island , Tanzania infected with T trichiura and concomitant intestinal nematodes . METHODS	We assigned children , via a randomisation list with block sizes of either four or eight , to orally receive albendazole ( 400 mg ) plus ivermectin ( 200 g/kg ) ; albendazole ( 400 mg ) plus mebendazole ( 500 mg ) ; albendazole ( 400 mg ) plus oxantel pamoate ( 20 mg/kg ) ; or mebendazole ( 500 mg ) alone . METHODS	The primary endpoints were the proportion of children cured of T trichiura infection and the reduction of T trichiura eggs in stool based on geometric means , both analysed by available case . METHODS	This study is registered with ISRCTN , number ISRCTN80245406 . RESULTS	We randomly assigned 440 eligible children infected with T trichiura between Sept 2 , and Oct 18 , 2013 , to one of the four treatment groups ( 110 children per group ) . RESULTS	Data for 431 children were included in the analysis for the primary endpoints . RESULTS	Albendazole plus oxantel pamoate ( 74 of 108 children cured [ 685 % , 95 % CI 596-774 ] ; egg reduction 992 % , 987-996 ) and albendazole plus ivermectin ( 30 of 109 cured [ 275 % , 190-360 ] ; egg reduction 945 % , 917-963 ) were significantly more effective against T trichiura than mebendazole alone ( nine of 107 cured [ 84 % , 31-138 ] ; egg reduction 585 % , 452-709 ) . RESULTS	Albendazole plus mebendazole had similar low efficacy ( nine of 107 cured [ 84 % , 31-138 ; egg reduction 516 % , 350-653 ) to mebendazole alone . RESULTS	About a fifth of the children reported adverse events , which were mainly mild . RESULTS	Abdominal cramps and headache were the most common adverse events after treatment ; abdominal cramps were reported by 13 ( 120 % ) children for albendazole plus ivermectin , 10 ( 93 % ) for albendazole plus mebendazole , 20 ( 182 % ) for albendazole plus oxantel pamoate , and 16 ( 145 % ) for mebendazole ; headaches were reported by 5 ( 46 % ) children for albendazole plus ivermectin , 6 ( 56 % ) for albendazole plus mebendazole , 12 ( 109 % ) for albendazole plus oxantel pamoate , and 7 ( 64 % ) for mebendazole . CONCLUSIONS	Our head-to-head comparison of three combination chemotherapies showed the highest efficacy for albendazole plus oxantel pamoate for the treatment of infection with T trichiura . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies should investigate the combination of albendazole plus oxantel pamoate so that it can be considered for soil-transmitted helminthiasis control programmes .

"OBJECTIVE	Apremilast , an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor , regulates inflammatory mediators . OBJECTIVE	Psoriatic Arthritis Long-term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy 1 ( PALACE 1 ) compared apremilast with placebo in patients with active psoriatic arthritis despite prior traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) and/or biologic therapy . METHODS	In the 24-week , placebo-controlled phase of PALACE 1 , patients ( N = 504 ) were randomised ( 1:1:1 ) to placebo , apremilast 20 mg twice a day ( BID ) or apremilast 30 mg BID . METHODS	At week 16 , patients without 20 % reduction in swollen and tender joint counts were required to be re-randomised equally to either apremilast dose if initially randomised to placebo or remained on their initial apremilast dose . METHODS	Patients on background concurrent DMARDs continued stable doses ( methotrexate , leflunomide and/or sulfasalazine ) . METHODS	Primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving 20 % improvement in modified American College of Rheumatology response criteria ( ACR20 ) at week 16 . RESULTS	At week 16 , significantly more apremilast 20 mg BID ( 31 % ) and 30 mg BID ( 40 % ) patients achieved ACR20 versus placebo ( 19 % ) ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Significant improvements in key secondary measures ( physical function , psoriasis ) were evident with both apremilast doses versus placebo . RESULTS	Across outcome measures , the 30-mg group generally had higher and more consistent response rates , although statistical comparison was not conducted . RESULTS	The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and generally occurred early , were self-limiting and infrequently led to discontinuation . RESULTS	No imbalance in major adverse cardiac events , serious or opportunistic infections , malignancies or laboratory abnormalities was observed . CONCLUSIONS	Apremilast was effective in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis , improving signs and symptoms and physical function . CONCLUSIONS	Apremilast demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated . BACKGROUND	NCT01172938 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Previous studies comparing endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) results with different gauge needles have all been carried out with the stylet in place and show no clear advantage to the larger 22-G needle . OBJECTIVE	Similar data for stylet-free EUS-FNA ( SF-EUS-FNA ) are unavailable . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to determine whether diagnostic yield and specimen adequacy is superior with the 22-G needle as compared to the 25-G needle . METHODS	All patients 18 years referred for solid-lesion EUS-FNA were eligible . METHODS	Patients with suspected diagnosis of lymphoma , gastrointestinal stromal tumor , sarcoidosis , significant coagulopathy ( international normalized ratio > 1.5 or platelets < 50000/mm ( 3 ) ) , use of clopidogrel within 7 days of EUS , and pregnancy were excluded . METHODS	The two needles were compared regarding diagnostic yield , sample adequacy , bloodiness , ease of puncture , visibility , number of passes , failures , and complications . RESULTS	One hundred and twenty consecutive patients were included and 126 lesions were sampled . RESULTS	Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the 22-G SF-EUS-FNA were 83 % , 100 % , 100 % and 56 % , respectively , and for the 25-G SF-EUS-FNA were 88.8 % , 100 % , 100 % and 76.5 % , respectively ( P = NS ) . RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the 22-G and the 25-G FNA needles in sample adequacy , bloodiness , ease of puncture , FNA failure , visibility , number of passes and complications ; and no significant differences between either needle were found in relation to lesion site . CONCLUSIONS	For SF-EUS-FNA , the larger 22-G needle offers no advantage over the smaller 25-G needle ."
"BACKGROUND	Narrow-band imaging ( NBI ) endoscopy improves the detection of intestinal metaplasia . BACKGROUND	However , strategies to improve the visibility and diagnostic performance of NBI should be sought , as endoscopic views are often obscured by the presence of mucus . OBJECTIVE	To compare the visibility and diagnostic performance of NBI endoscopy according to pronase premedication in patients with precancerous conditions of the stomach . METHODS	Consecutive outpatients with a previous diagnosis of precancerous condition of the stomach were invited to undergo a surveillance NBI endoscopy between June and December 2012 . METHODS	Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to pronase or control groups before NBI endoscopy . METHODS	The visibility score and diagnostic performance of NBI endoscopy were compared between the two groups . RESULTS	Patients ' endoscopic and histopathological characteristics were similar between the two groups . RESULTS	Visibility score in the proximal part of the stomach and satisfaction score of the endoscopist were significantly higher in the pronase group than in the control group ( p = 0.014 and p = 0.034 , respectively ) . RESULTS	The diagnostic performance of NBI endoscopy to detect intestinal metaplasia was not different in either group ( both p > 0.1 ) . RESULTS	However , the negative predictive value of NBI endoscopy was much improved over that of white light endoscopy only in the pronase group ( p = 0.013 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Pronase premedication increased the visibility of the proximal part of the stomach and the satisfaction score during NBI endoscopy . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , negative predictive value of NBI endoscopy was much improved compared with that of white light endoscopy after pronase premedication ."
"BACKGROUND	The incidence , predictors , and prognostic impact of post-discharge bleeding ( PDB ) after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) with drug-eluting stent ( DES ) implantation are unclear . OBJECTIVE	This study sought to characterize the determinants and consequences of PDB after PCI . METHODS	The prospective ADAPT-DES ( Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents ) study was used to determine the incidence and predictors of clinically relevant bleeding events occurring within 2 years after hospital discharge . METHODS	The effect of PDB on subsequent 2-year all-cause mortality was estimated by time-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression . RESULTS	Among 8,582 `` all-comers '' who underwent successful PCI with DES in the ADAPT-DES study , PDB occurred in 535 of 8,577 hospital survivors ( 6.2 % ) at a median time of 300 days ( interquartile range : 130 to 509 days ) post-discharge . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal bleeding ( 61.7 % ) was the most frequent source of PDB . RESULTS	Predictors of PDB included older age , lower baseline hemoglobin , lower platelet reactivity on clopidogrel , and use of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy . RESULTS	PDB was associated with higher crude rates of all-cause mortality ( 13.0 % vs. 3.2 % ; p < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Following multivariable adjustment , PDB was strongly associated with 2-year mortality ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 5.03 ; p < 0.0001 ) , with an effect size greater than that of post-discharge myocardial infarction ( PDMI ) ( HR : 1.92 ; p = 0.009 ) . CONCLUSIONS	After successful PCI with DES in an unrestricted patient population , PDB is not uncommon and has a strong relationship with subsequent all-cause mortality , greater that that associated with PDMI . CONCLUSIONS	Efforts to reduce PDB may further improve prognosis after successful DES implantation . CONCLUSIONS	( Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents [ ADAPT-DES ] ; NCT00638794 ) ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy of a standard triple therapy ( comprising rabeprazole , clarithromycin , and amoxicillin ) for Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) eradication , noting factors that influence the outcome and documenting any adverse events . METHODS	Following institutional ethical approval , fifty consecutive and consenting symptomatic patients with evidence of H. pylori infection by either a positive urea breath test ( UBT ) and/or a campylobacter-like organism test who presented to the Gastroenterology clinic of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital between 2012 and 2013 were recruited into the study . METHODS	Patients were openly randomized to either a 7-d or a 10-d regimen of amoxicillin 1 g , clarithromycin 500 mg and rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily . METHODS	The extent of symptom resolution was noted following the treatment , and at the end of one month after the completion of treatment , a repeat UBT was performed in each patient to document the eradication of the infection . METHODS	All data ( demographics , symptoms , and eradication rates ) were collated and analyzed with SPSS version 18 . RESULTS	Forty-seven patients completed the study ( three were excluded from the analysis for breaching the study protocol ) . RESULTS	The patients included 18 males and 29 females within the age range of 13-80 years ( mean 43.7 , SD 16.8 ) . RESULTS	The clinical features of the study subjects were dyspepsia , reflux symptoms and features of gastrointestinal bleeding . RESULTS	The average eradication rate was 87.2 % . RESULTS	Eighteen subjects were enrolled in the 7-d arm , while 29 were in the 10-d arm . RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in the age or sex distributions of the two arms . RESULTS	There was no significant advantage of the 10-d treatment duration over the 7-d duration ( P = 0.78 ) , and the eradication outcomes were not influenced by the gender or age of the subjects . RESULTS	No adverse effects were reported in either arm . CONCLUSIONS	The triple therapy regime , employing a combination of amoxicillin , clarithromycin and rabeprazole , showed great efficacy and safety in the eradication of H. pylori , and this outcome was not influenced by gender or age . CONCLUSIONS	No difference was observed between the 7-d and 10-d regimens ."

METHODS	Prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . METHODS	Seventy-nine US and Canadian centers . METHODS	Patients aged 18 years with OIC , defined as < 3 spontaneous bowel movements ( SBMs ) per week . METHODS	Patients received lubiprostone 24 mcg or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks . METHODS	The primary endpoint was change from baseline in SBM frequency at week 8 . RESULTS	Among randomized patients ( N = 418 ; lubiprostone , N = 210 ; placebo , N = 208 ) , most completed the study ( lubiprostone , 67.1 % ; placebo , 69.7 % ) . RESULTS	The safety and efficacy ( intent-to-treat ) populations included 414 ( lubiprostone , N = 208 ; placebo , N = 206 ) and 413 ( lubiprostone , N = 209 ; placebo , N = 204 ) patients , respectively . RESULTS	The mean ( standard deviation ) age was 50.4 ( 10.9 ) years ; most patients were female ( 64.4 % ) and white ( 77.7 % ) . RESULTS	Changes from baseline in SBM frequency rates were significantly higher at week 8 ( P = 0.005 ) and overall ( P = 0.004 ) in patients treated with lubiprostone compared with placebo . RESULTS	Pairwise comparisons showed significantly greater overall improvement for abdominal discomfort ( P = 0.047 ) , straining ( P < 0.001 ) , constipation severity ( P = 0.007 ) , and stool consistency ( P < 0.001 ) with lubiprostone compared with placebo . RESULTS	Moreover , patients rated the effectiveness of lubiprostone as significantly ( P < 0.05 ) better than placebo for 11 of 12 weeks . RESULTS	The most common treatment-related adverse events ( AEs ) with lubiprostone and placebo were nausea ( 16.8 % vs 5.8 % , respectively ) , diarrhea ( 9.6 % vs 2.9 % ) , and abdominal distention ( 8.2 % vs 2.4 % ) . RESULTS	No lubiprostone-related serious AEs occurred . CONCLUSIONS	Lubiprostone effectively relieved OIC and associated signs and symptoms and was well tolerated in patients with chronic noncancer pain ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00595946 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Healthy gut microflora is essential for oral tolerance and immunity . BACKGROUND	A promising approach to preventing allergic diseases in genetically at-risk infants is to introduce administration of probiotics early in life when their immune system is still relatively immature . OBJECTIVE	In this follow-up study , we aim to determine if early-life supplementation with strains of probiotics has any long-term effect on allergic outcomes . METHODS	We analyzed the charts and electronic databases of the PROMPT ( Probiotics in Milk for the Prevention of Atopy Trial ) study cohort . METHODS	This cohort consisted of 253 infants at risk for allergy who were administered cow 's milk supplemented with or without probiotics from the first day of life to the age of 6 months . METHODS	The cohort was then followed up until the children were 5 years old and clinical outcomes were assessed . RESULTS	Of the 253 children recruited into the study , 220 ( 87 % ) completed the follow-up . RESULTS	At the age of 5 years , there were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of children who had developed any asthma , allergic rhinitis , eczema , food allergy and sensitization to inhalant allergens . RESULTS	Similar growth rates were observed in both groups . CONCLUSIONS	The supplementation of probiotics in early childhood did not play a role in the prevention of allergic diseases . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical/Key Message : Early-life supplementation with probiotics did not change allergic outcomes at 5 years of age ."
"BACKGROUND	Triptans are a family of selective serotonin ( 5-HT1B / 1D ) receptor agonists that are widely used to treat acute migraine attacks . BACKGROUND	Their efficacy is limited by side effects and the gastrointestinal manifestations of migraine . OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of a single intravenous administration of propacetamol , a prodrug of paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) with a single dose of oral rizatriptan in treating acute migraine attacks . METHODS	Patients were selected from those who presented to the emergency room with a diagnosed migraine attack and who had not previously taken any analgesics . METHODS	They were randomized into 2 groups : treatment with a single 1g IV dose of propacetamol or with a single oral dose of 5mg rizatriptan . METHODS	Their Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) pain scores were assessed before and at 30 , 60 , and 120min after treatment . RESULTS	The patients who received the propacetamol had significantly improved VAS scores at 60min compared to the rizatriptan group . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in VAS scores at 30 or 120min post-treatment . CONCLUSIONS	Propacetamol is either equivalent or superior in efficacy to rizatriptan for treating acute migraine attacks , while having the advantage of parenteral administration in patients whose migraines are accompanied by nausea and vomiting ."
"BACKGROUND	Poor sanitation is thought to be a major cause of enteric infections among young children . BACKGROUND	However , there are no previously published randomized trials to measure the health impacts of large-scale sanitation programs . BACKGROUND	India 's Total Sanitation Campaign ( TSC ) is one such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors , and providing technical support and financial subsidies . BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to measure the effect of the TSC implemented with capacity building support from the World Bank 's Water and Sanitation Program in Madhya Pradesh on availability of individual household latrines ( IHLs ) , defecation behaviors , and child health ( diarrhea , highly credible gastrointestinal illness [ HCGI ] , parasitic infections , anemia , growth ) . RESULTS	We conducted a cluster-randomized , controlled trial in 80 rural villages . RESULTS	Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions , behaviors , and child health ( May-July 2009 ) , and revisited households 21 months later ( February-April 2011 ) after the program was delivered . RESULTS	The study enrolled a random sample of 5,209 children < 5 years old from 3,039 households that had at least one child < 24 months at the beginning of the study . RESULTS	A random subsample of 1,150 children < 24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool . RESULTS	The randomization successfully balanced intervention and control groups , and we estimated differences between groups in an intention to treat analysis . RESULTS	The intervention increased percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme by an average of 19 % ( 95 % CI for difference : 12 % -26 % ; group means : 22 % control versus 41 % intervention ) , decreased open defecation among adults by an average of 10 % ( 95 % CI for difference : 4 % -15 % ; group means : 73 % intervention versus 84 % control ) . RESULTS	However , the intervention did not improve child health measured in terms of multiple health outcomes ( diarrhea , HCGI , helminth infections , anemia , growth ) . RESULTS	Limitations of the study included a relatively short follow-up period following implementation , evidence for contamination in ten of the 40 control villages , and bias possible in self-reported outcomes for diarrhea , HCGI , and open defecation behaviors . CONCLUSIONS	The intervention led to modest increases in availability of IHLs and even more modest reductions in open defecation . CONCLUSIONS	These improvements were insufficient to improve child health outcomes ( diarrhea , HCGI , parasite infection , anemia , growth ) . CONCLUSIONS	The results underscore the difficulty of achieving adequately large improvements in sanitation levels to deliver expected health benefits within large-scale rural sanitation programs . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01465204 . BACKGROUND	Please see later in the article for the Editors ' Summary ."
"BACKGROUND	Fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) improves glycemic control in diabetic animals and is secreted from the gastrointestinal tract after meals in response to bile acid stimulation . OBJECTIVE	We sought to understand how ingestion of carbohydrates , protein or lipids affect both FGF19 and bile acid concentrations in human plasma , with the hypothesis that variation in the bile acid response to different macronutrients would predict differences in plasma FGF19 levels . METHODS	This was a randomized , within-subjects crossover study . METHODS	The study was conducted at a university clinical research center . METHODS	There were 16 healthy human subjects included in the study . METHODS	Isocaloric , isovolemic beverages composed primarily of carbohydrates , proteins , or lipids were provided to each participant on 3 separate occasions . METHODS	The magnitudes of postprandial rises of plasma FGF19 and total bile acid levels were determined . RESULTS	All beverages induced an initial transient decline of plasma FGF19 levels during the first 60 minutes after consumption . RESULTS	For FGF19 , the ingestion of carbohydrate was associated with the fastest and highest increase of plasma levels , returning to baseline at 5 hours . RESULTS	By comparison , the protein beverage induced a modest but significant elevation of FGF19 levels that peaked at the end of the 6-hour sampling interval , whereas a lipid beverage was without effect . RESULTS	In contrast , total bile acid levels increased in plasma only in response to a high-lipid beverage , demonstrating a marked divergence between the FGF19 and bile acid response to lipid vs carbohydrate . CONCLUSIONS	A bile acid-independent mechanism is implicated in the effect of meals to raise plasma FGF19 concentrations ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of two maternal feeding policies-early versus conventional oral feeding-after cesarean delivery . METHODS	This prospective multicenter randomized comparative trial was conducted at tertiary care hospitals in Sindh , Pakistan , from 2010 to 2012 . METHODS	Women with an uncomplicated cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were allocated to an intervention of early ( after 2 hours ) or conventional ( after 18 hours ) initiation of oral feeding . METHODS	Outcomes included maternal ambulation , maternal satisfaction , gastrointestinal functions , and length of hospital stay . RESULTS	In total , 1174 women ( n = 587 per group ) were included in the final analysis . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal complications were not significantly different between the two groups . RESULTS	Lower intensities of thirst and hunger and a higher rate of maternal satisfaction were observed in the early feeding group ( P < 0.05 ) , and 53.8 % of women in this group were able to ambulate within 15 hours of surgery , compared with 27.9 % of women in the conventional feeding group . RESULTS	The frequencies of readmission , febrile morbidity , and wound infection were insignificant . CONCLUSIONS	Early oral dietary initiation after cesarean delivery resulted in early ambulation , greater maternal satisfaction , and reduced length of hospital stay , with no detrimental outcomes , making this practice cost-effective . CONCLUSIONS	Hence , day-care cesarean delivery might be an option in resource-constrained settings . BACKGROUND	ChiCTR-TRC-13003651 , http://www.chictr.org ."

OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei subsp . OBJECTIVE	paracasei , L. casei 431 ( Chr . OBJECTIVE	Hansen A/S ) ( hereafter , L. casei 431 ) on immune response to influenza vaccination and respiratory symptoms in healthy adults . METHODS	A randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 1104 healthy subjects aged 18-60 y at 2 centers in Germany and Denmark . METHODS	Subjects were randomly assigned to receive an acidified milk drink containing 10 ( 9 ) colony-forming units of L. casei 431 ( n = 553 ) or placebo ( n = 551 ) for 42 d. METHODS	After 21 d , subjects received the seasonal influenza vaccination . METHODS	The primary outcome was seroprotection rate ( anti-influenza antibody titers by hemagglutination inhibition ) 21 d after vaccination . METHODS	Other outcomes were seroconversion rate and mean titers , influenza A-specific antibodies and incidence , and duration and severity of upper respiratory symptoms . METHODS	Antibiotic use and use of health care resources were recorded . RESULTS	There was no effect of L. casei 431 on immune responses to influenza vaccination . RESULTS	Generalized linear mixed modeling showed a shorter duration of upper respiratory symptoms in the probiotic group than in the placebo group ( mean SD : 6.4 6.1 vs. 7.3 9.7 d , P = 0.0059 ) in the last 3 wk of the intervention period . RESULTS	No statistically significant differences were found for incidence or severity . CONCLUSIONS	Daily consumption of L. casei 431 resulted in no observable effect on the components of the immune response to influenza vaccination but reduced the duration of upper respiratory symptoms . CONCLUSIONS	The trial was registered at www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN08280229 ."
"BACKGROUND	Vaccination as a control method against the cattle tick , Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) microplus has been practiced since the introduction of two products in the mid-1990s . BACKGROUND	There is a need for a vaccine that could provide effective control of R. microplus in a more consistent fashion than existing products . BACKGROUND	During our transcriptome studies of R. microplus , several gene coding regions were discovered to encode proteins with significant amino acid similarity to aquaporins . METHODS	A cDNA encoding an aquaporin from the cattle tick , Rhipicephalus microplus , was isolated from transcriptomic studies conducted on gut tissues dissected from fully engorged adult female R. microplus . RESULTS	Bioinformatic analysis indicates this aquaporin , designated RmAQP1 , shows greatest amino acid similarity to the human aquaporin 7 family . RESULTS	Members of this family of water-conducting channels can also facilitate the transport of glycerol in addition to water . RESULTS	The efficacy of this aquaporin as an antigen against the cattle tick was explored in cattle vaccine trials conducted in Brazil . RESULTS	A cDNA encoding a significant portion of RmAQP1 was expressed as a recombinant protein in Pichia pastoris , purified under native conditions using a polyhistidine C-terminus tag and nickel affinity chromatography , emulsified with Montanide adjuvant , and cattle vaccinated intramuscularly . RESULTS	The recombinant protein provided 75 % and 68 % efficacy in two cattle pen trials conducted in Campo Grande , Brazil on groups of 6 one year old Holstein calves . CONCLUSIONS	The effectiveness of this vaccine in reducing the numbers of adult female ticks shows this aquaporin antigen holds promise as an active ingredient in cattle vaccines targeted against infestations of R. microplus ."
"BACKGROUND	The effects of tongue cleaning on reconstruction of bacterial flora in dental plaque and tongue coating itself are obscure . BACKGROUND	We assessed changes in the amounts of total bacteria as well as Fusobacterium nucleatum in tongue coating and dental plaque specimens obtained with and without tongue cleaning . METHODS	We conducted a randomized examiner-blind crossover study using 30 volunteers ( average 23.7 3.2 years old ) without periodontitis . METHODS	After dividing randomly into 2 groups , 1 group was instructed to clean the tongue , while the other did not . METHODS	On days 1 ( baseline ) , 3 , and 10 , tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected after recording tongue coating score ( Winkel tongue coating index : WTCI ) . METHODS	After a washout period of 3 weeks , the same examinations were performed with the subjects allocated to the alternate group . METHODS	Genomic DNA was purified from the samples and applied to SYBR Green-based real-time PCR to quantify the amounts of total bacteria and F. nucleatum . RESULTS	After 3 days , the WTCI score recovered to baseline , though the amount of total bacteria in tongue coating was significantly lower as compared to the baseline . RESULTS	In plaque samples , the bacterial amounts on day 3 and 10 were significantly lower than the baseline with and without tongue cleaning . RESULTS	Principal component analysis showed that variations of bacterial amounts in the tongue coating and dental plaque samples were independent from each other . RESULTS	Furthermore , we found a strong association between amounts of total bacteria and F. nucleatum in specimens both . CONCLUSIONS	Tongue cleaning reduced the amount of bacteria in tongue coating . CONCLUSIONS	However , the cleaning had no obvious contribution to inhibit dental plaque formation . CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , recovery of the total bacterial amount induced an increase in F. nucleatum in both tongue coating and dental plaque . CONCLUSIONS	Thus , it is recommended that tongue cleaning and tooth brushing should both be performed for promoting oral health ."
"OBJECTIVE	Freeze-dried powdered yacon ( FDY ) can be considered a prebiotic product due to its fructooligosaccharides ( FOS ) content . OBJECTIVE	The effect of 9weeks of daily intake of FDY containing 7.4 g of FOS on glucose , lipid metabolism and intestinal transit in a group of elderly people was investigated . METHODS	Seventy-two elderly ( mean age 67.116.11 ) men and women were studied for 9weeks in a double-blind , placebo-controlled experiment . METHODS	They were randomly assigned to the supplement group ( which received 7.4 g of FOS as FDY ) or the control group . METHODS	At the beginning and end of the study , anthropometric measurements , blood sampling , clinical analyses and dietary intake were assessed . RESULTS	A daily intake of FDY containing 7.4 g of FOS for 9weeks was associated with a mean decrease in serum glucose ( p = 0.013 ) , but supplementation did not reduce serum lipids in the study group . RESULTS	The administered dose did not adversely affect intestinal transit . RESULTS	It did not cause bloating , flatulence or intestinal discomfort . CONCLUSIONS	Freeze-dried powdered yacon is a good source of FOS , and daily consumption can have a favourable effect on serum glucose in the elderly . CONCLUSIONS	It is also practical , easy and safe to use and store ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to explore whether administration timing affects glycaemic control by lixisenatide once-daily in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . METHODS	A phase IIIb , open-label , 1:1 randomized , active-controlled , 24-week multicentre study of T2DM patients inadequately controlled on metformin was conducted . METHODS	Patients were administered lixisenatide before breakfast or the main meal . METHODS	The primary endpoint was change from baseline at week 24 in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . METHODS	Other endpoints : changes in body weight , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , 7-point self-monitored plasma glucose ( SMPG ) and Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status ( DTSQs ) score . METHODS	Adverse events ( AEs ) were monitored . RESULTS	Mean change in HbA1c from baseline at week 24 was -0.65 % ( -7.1 mmol/mol ; main meal ) and -0.74 % ( -8.1 mmol/mol ; breakfast ) . RESULTS	Mean changes in FPG , body weight and DTSQs score were comparable between groups . RESULTS	The mean change in body weight ( kg ) was -2.60 ( main meal ) and -2.80 ( breakfast group ) . RESULTS	The 7-point SMPG profiles showed greatest reductions in postprandial glucose after the meal at which lixisenatide was administered , with a residual effect seen on the subsequent meal . RESULTS	AE rates were similar between groups , including gastrointestinal AEs . CONCLUSIONS	Lixisenatide before the main meal was noninferior to lixisenatide before breakfast in patients insufficiently controlled on metformin . CONCLUSIONS	Lixisenatide treatment allows flexibility in administration timing ."
"OBJECTIVE	This article is based on our previously reported results of irregular bowel movement and disturbances of the intestinal microbiota/environment in gastrectomized patients . OBJECTIVE	A placebo-controlled , double-blind comparative study was carried out to evaluate the effects of a fermented milk beverage containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota ( LcS ) in such patients . OBJECTIVE	The major evaluated factors of this article were `` bowel movement '' and `` quality of life . '' OBJECTIVE	The secondary evaluated factors were `` fecal microbiota '' and `` enteric environment . '' METHODS	Of the 190 gastrectomized subjects who participated in our previously reported defecation survey , 134 subjects judged as having abnormal defecation gave consent to participate in this study . METHODS	These subjects continuously ingested the test beverage containing 40 billion LcS or placebo ( one bottle per day , 4 weeks ) . RESULTS	In the LcS-ingested group , among the 118 subjects who completed the tests , the assessments of the subjects were based on their division into groups based on their symptoms with our scoring system for constipation/diarrhea ; although there was no significant ingestion effect in total , in the constipation group , LcS reduced the degree of constipation compared with that in the placebo group . RESULTS	In the diarrhea group , LcS ingestion improved diarrhea compared with that in the preingestion state . RESULTS	Fecal Staphylococcus level was decreased . CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest the possibility that the continuous consumption of LcS-fermented milk relieves irregular bowel movement in gastrectomized patients ."
"BACKGROUND	Microbial translocation has been associated with an increase in immune activation and inflammation in HIV infection despite effective highly active antiretroviral therapy . BACKGROUND	It has been shown that some probiotics have a beneficial effect by reducing intestinal permeability and , consequently , microbial translocation . OBJECTIVE	To assess changes in microbial translocation and inflammation after treatment with probiotics ( Saccharomyces boulardii ) in HIV-1-infected patients with virologic suppression . METHODS	A double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 44 nonconsecutive HIV-1-infected patients with viral load of < 20 copies per milliliter for at least 2 years . METHODS	Patients were randomized to oral supplementation with probiotics or placebo during 12 weeks . METHODS	Markers of microbial translocation ( lipopolysaccharide-binding protein [ LBP ] and soluble CD14 ) , inflammation ( interleukin 6 [ IL-6 ] , tumor necrosis factor alpha , interferon gamma , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ) , and immunological and clinical data were determined before and after the intervention and 3 months after treatment discontinuation . METHODS	Quantitative variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test , and categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test . RESULTS	After 12 weeks of treatment , differences between the probiotic arm and the placebo arm were observed in LBP values ( -0.30 vs +0.70 pg/mL ) and IL-6 ( -0.60 vs +0.78 pg/mL ) . RESULTS	These differences were also noted at 3 months after treatment withdrawal . RESULTS	Qualitative analysis was performed , defining a variable as `` decreased '' or `` increased '' from baseline LBP . RESULTS	A significant decrease of LBP at 12 weeks of treatment was observed ( 57.9 % patients in the probiotic group vs 6.2 % in the placebo group , P = 0.002 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with S. boulardii decreases microbial translocation ( LBP ) and inflammation parameters ( IL-6 ) in HIV-1-infected patients with long-term virologic suppression ."
"OBJECTIVE	To explore the acute toxic effects and early curative efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy with different doses of cisplatin for Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) patients using intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . METHODS	Eighty-eight untreated stage II/III nasopharyngeal cancer patients receiving IMRT and concurrent cisplatin were randomized into two groups receiving different doses of cisplatin . METHODS	The standard group ( DDP 100 mg/m q3w , n = 44 ) and the study group ( DDP 80 mg/m q3w , n = 44 ) . METHODS	The acute toxic effects and 3-month therapeutic efficacy ( early curative efficacy ) in patients of the two groups who completed treatment were compared and analyzed . RESULTS	During the treatment , grade III-IV acute toxic effects were observed in more patients of the standard group compared with that in the study group ( 72.7 % vs. 59.1 % ) , but the difference was statistically not significant ( P = 0.18 ) . RESULTS	Significant difference was only seen in upper gastrointestinal reaction ( P = 0.01 ) and anemia ( P = 0.03 ) among the non-hematological and hematological adverse events . RESULTS	No significant differences in other adverse events were found between the two groups ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Three months after the completion of radiotherapy , 80 cases of the whole group achieved complete remission ( CR ) in the nasopharynx and neck MRI . RESULTS	In both the standard group and study group , 40 patients had CR and 4 patients had residual disease , respectively , showing a non-significant difference ( P = 0.51 ) between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	During the IMRT course , patients received cisplatin 80 mg/m q3w , experienced less grade III-IV acute toxic effects . CONCLUSIONS	Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin 80 mg/m q3w or 100 mg/m q3w , demonstrate similar early curative efficacy in II/III stage NPC patients in endemic regions of China ."
"BACKGROUND	Two strategies to interrogate the insulin growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) pathway were investigated : vertical inhibition with dalotuzumab and MK-2206 or ridaforolimus to potentiate PI3K pathway targeting and horizontal cross-talk inhibition with dalotuzumab and MK-0752 to exert effects against cellular proliferation , angiogenesis , and stem cell propagation . METHODS	A phase I , multi-cohort dose escalation study was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumours . METHODS	Patients received dalotuzumab ( 10mgkg ( -1 ) ) and escalating doses of MK-2206 ( 90-200mg ) or escalating doses of dalotuzumab ( 7.5-10mgkg ( -1 ) ) and MK-0752 ( 1800mg ) weekly . METHODS	Upon maximum tolerated dose determination , patients with low-RAS signature , high-IGF1 expression ovarian cancer were randomised to dalotuzumab/MK -2206 versus dalotuzumab/ridaforolimus , whereas patients with high IGF1/low IGF2 expression colorectal cancer received dalotuzumab/MK -0752 . RESULTS	A total of 47 patients were enrolled : 29 in part A ( 18 in the dalotuzumab/MK -2206 arm and 11 in the dalotuzumab/MK -0752 arm ) and 18 in part B ( 6 in each arm ) . RESULTS	Dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) for dalotuzumab/MK -2206 included grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 serum sickness-like reaction , maculopapular rash , and gastrointestinal inflammation . RESULTS	For dalotuzumab/MK -0752 , DLTs included grade 3 dehydration , rash , and diarrhoea . RESULTS	Seven patients remained on study for > 4 cycles . CONCLUSIONS	Dalotuzumab/MK -2206 and dalotuzumab/MK -0752 combinations were tolerable . CONCLUSIONS	Further developments of prospectively validated predictive biomarkers to aid in patient selection for anti-IGF-1R therapies are needed ."
"BACKGROUND	Compared with nonaerated , isocaloric controls , aerated foods can reduce appetite throughout an entire dieting day . BACKGROUND	Increased gastric volumes and delayed emptying are possible but unexplored mechanisms . OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that aerated drinks ( foams ) of differing gastric stability would increase gastric distension and reduce appetite compared with a control drink . METHODS	In a randomized , balanced , crossover trial , 18 healthy male participants consumed the following 3 skimmed-milk-based test products ( all 110 kcal ) : 2 drinks aerated to foams by whipping ( to 490 mL ) , one drink that was stable in the stomach [ stable foam ( SF ) ] , and one drink that was less stable in the stomach [ less-stable foam ( LSF ) ] , and a nonaerated drink [ liquid control ( LC ) ; 140 mL ] . METHODS	Over 4 h , stomach contents ( foam , air , and liquid ) were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and self-reported appetite ratings were collected and quantified by the area under the curve or time to return to baseline ( TTRTB ) . RESULTS	Compared with the LC , both foams caused significantly increased gastric volumes and reduced hunger ( all P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Compared with the LSF , SF further produced a significantly slower decrease in the total gastric content ( P < 0.05 ) and foam volume ( P < 0.0001 ) and a longer TTRTB ( 197 compared with 248 min , respectively ; P < 0.05 ) , although the hunger AUC was not statistically different . RESULTS	Results for other appetite scales were similar . CONCLUSIONS	With this MRI trial , we provide novel insights on the gastrointestinal behavior of aerated drinks by measuring separate volumes of foam , liquid , and air layers in the stomach . CONCLUSIONS	Appetite suppression induced by foams could largely be explained by effects on gastric volumes and emptying , which may be further enhanced by foam stability . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01690182 ."
"BACKGROUND	Casein is considered a slowly digestible protein compared with whey protein , and this may cause differences in hormone responses and the kinetics of delivering amino acids into the circulation . OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether postprandial plasma hormone and metabolite responses were different when bovine casein or whey protein was co-administered with carbohydrates in healthy and prediabetic adults . METHODS	White healthy male adults ( n = 15 ) and white , well-defined male and female prediabetic adults ( n = 15 ) received test drinks randomly on 3 different occasions at least 2 d apart which contained 50 g of maltodextrin19 ( MD19 ) alone or in combination with 50 g of whey protein isolate ( WPI ) or 50 g of sodium caseinate ( SC ) . METHODS	Blood samples were collected over a 240-min time period and were analyzed for hormone profiles and defined metabolites . RESULTS	No evidence was found that gastric emptying was different between the 2 protein drinks . RESULTS	Both proteins increased peak plasma insulin concentrations in prediabetic persons by 96 % compared with MD19 ( each , P < 0.05 ) , which was accompanied by a reduction of peak venous blood glucose by 21 % ( each , P < 0.0001 ) without a difference between the 2 proteins . RESULTS	Peak plasma glucagon concentrations increased by 101 % in both groups after the protein drinks ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The WPI drink also increased peak plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations in healthy volunteers by 56 % ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Differences in plasma metabolite concentrations in volunteers could be attributed exclusively to the differences in the amino acid composition of the 2 proteins ingested . CONCLUSIONS	The WPI and the SC drinks similarly reduced postprandial glucose excursions when ingested with carbohydrates in healthy and prediabetic volunteers . CONCLUSIONS	Under our experimental conditions , however , no evidence was found that gastrointestinal processing of the 2 protein varieties differed substantially . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as DRKS00005682 ."
"BACKGROUND	The main goal of this randomized controlled single-blinded pilot study was to study whether , independent of weight loss , a Palaeolithic-type diet alters characteristics of the metabolic syndrome . BACKGROUND	Next we searched for outcome variables that might become favourably influenced by a Paleolithic-type diet and may provide new insights in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the metabolic syndrome . BACKGROUND	In addition , more information on feasibility and designing an innovative dietary research program on the basis of a Palaeolithic-type diet was obtained . METHODS	Thirty-four subjects , with at least two characteristics of the metabolic syndrome , were randomized to a two weeks Palaeolithic-type diet ( n = 18 ) or an isoenergetic healthy reference diet , based on the guidelines of the Dutch Health Council ( n = 14 ) . METHODS	Thirty-two subjects completed the study . METHODS	Measures were taken to keep bodyweight stable . METHODS	As primary outcomes oral glucose tolerance and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome ( abdominal circumference , blood pressure , glucose , lipids ) were measured . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were intestinal permeability , inflammation and salivary cortisol . METHODS	Data were collected at baseline and after the intervention . RESULTS	Subjects were 53.5 ( SD9 .7 ) year old men ( n = 9 ) and women ( n = 25 ) with mean BMI of 31.8 ( SD5 .7 ) kg/m2 . RESULTS	The Palaeolithic-type diet resulted in lower systolic blood pressure ( -9.1 mmHg ; P = 0.015 ) , diastolic blood pressure ( -5.2 mmHg ; P = 0.038 ) , total cholesterol ( -0.52 mmol/l ; P = 0.037 ) , triglycerides ( -0.89 mmol/l ; P = 0.001 ) and higher HDL-cholesterol ( +0.15 mmol/l ; P = 0.013 ) , compared to reference . RESULTS	The number of characteristics of the metabolic syndrome decreased with 1.07 ( P = 0.010 ) upon the Palaeolithic-type diet , compared to reference . RESULTS	Despite efforts to keep bodyweight stable , it decreased in the Palaeolithic group compared to reference ( -1.32 kg ; P = 0.012 ) . RESULTS	However , favourable effects remained after post-hoc adjustments for this unintended weight loss . RESULTS	No changes were observed for intestinal permeability , inflammation and salivary cortisol . CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that consuming a Palaeolithic-type diet for two weeks improved several cardiovascular risk factors compared to a healthy reference diet in subjects with the metabolic syndrome .

"OBJECTIVE	To explore the effect of acupuncture-anesthetic composite anesthesia ( AACA ) on the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) and changes of TNF-alpha , IL-1beta , and IL-6 in elderly patients . METHODS	Totally 83 patients undergoing surgical resection of gastrointestinal tumor were randomly assigned to the simple anesthesia group ( A group , 41 cases ) and the AACA group ( B group , 42 cases ) . METHODS	Patients in Group A received endotracheal general anesthesia . METHODS	Those in Group B were induced by acupuncture anesthesia for 30 min by needling at Baihui ( DU20 ) , Neiguan ( PC6 ) , Zusanli ( ST36 ) . METHODS	The electro-acupuncture ( EA ) apparatus was connected after arrival of qi , with the wave pattern of density 2/100 Hz . METHODS	The stimulus intensity was set by patients ' tolerance , with the peak current of 5 mA . METHODS	Then the endotracheal general anesthesia was performed and the EA lasted till the end of the surgery . METHODS	The cognitive function of all patients was assessed before operation and at day 3 after operation using mini-mental state examination ( MMSE ) . METHODS	POCD was confirmed if with one or more decreased stand - ard . METHODS	The peripheral venous blood was collected before anesthesia induction ( TO ) , immediately at the end of surgery ( T1 ) , 24 h after operation ( T2 ) , and 48 h after operation ( T3 ) , and serum concentrations of IL-1beta , IL-6 , and TNF-alpha were correspondingly measured using ELISA . RESULTS	The postoperative anesthesia awakening time was shorter in Group B than in Group A [ ( 20.37 + / - 6.09 ) min vs ( 29.24 + / - 7.48 ) min , P < 0.05 ] . RESULTS	The remifentanil dose used during the operation was less in Group B than in Group A ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The incidence of POCD at day 3 was lower in Group B than in Group A [ 10/41 ( 23.8 % ) vs 15/42 ( 36.5 % ) , P < 0.05 ] . RESULTS	The concentrations of IL-1beta , IL-6 , and TNF-alpha at T1-T3 were higher than those at TO in the two groups ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The increment of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta was less in Group B than in Group A ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	CONCLUSION AACA could reduce the incidence of POCD and inhibit postoperative release of TNF-alpha , IL-1beta , and IL-6 in elderly patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection ."
"BACKGROUND	Perioperative prophylactic antibiotic treatment significantly influences intestinal microflora , resulting in impaired bowel functioning in some patients , sometimes requiring further investigations . BACKGROUND	This may lead to a worse health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) . BACKGROUND	Probiotics administrated in the early post-operative period may help avoiding such nuisances in older people . METHODS	We prospectively enrolled patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery aged over 70 years between 2005 and 2012 . METHODS	The study was approved by IRB . METHODS	All patients received perioperative antibiotic treatment . METHODS	Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms : Group A patients received probiotics after surgery ( VSL # 3 , VSL Pharmaceuticals , Inc. . METHODS	USA - 900 109 daily , while Group B patients received a Placebo ( cornstarch ) . METHODS	Patients were further divided in sub-groups whether ileo-caecal valve was spared or not . METHODS	Patients were followed-up every 7 days for 4 weeks . METHODS	Patients daily annotated bowel frequency , stool shape and consistency - according to Bristol 's scale . METHODS	HRQoL was assessed every week by means of SF-36 questionnaire . RESULTS	Group A included 10 while Group B included 8 patients . RESULTS	One patient in each group experienced a postoperative complication . RESULTS	Group A patients had fewer bowel movements than controls , during every week . RESULTS	Stool consistency was higher in patients undergoing resections including ileo-caecal valve receiving VSL # 3 . RESULTS	HRQoL gradually increased in both groups ; Group A patients had higher `` social functioning '' item scores at week 1 and 4 than controls . CONCLUSIONS	Elderly patients undergoing resection of ileo-caecal valve may benefit from an early probiotics administration pathway after perioperative antibiotic treatment ."
"BACKGROUND	Hemodialysis patients are high absorbers of intestinal cholesterol ; they benefit less than other patient groups from statin therapy , which inhibits cholesterol synthesis . OBJECTIVE	This study sought to investigate whether the individual cholesterol absorption rate affects atorvastatin 's effectiveness to reduce cardiovascular risk in hemodialysis patients . METHODS	This post-hoc analysis included 1,030 participants in the German Diabetes and Dialysis Study ( 4D ) who were randomized to either 20 mg of atorvastatin ( n = 519 ) or placebo ( n = 511 ) . METHODS	The primary endpoint was a composite of major cardiovascular events . METHODS	Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality and all cardiac events . METHODS	Tertiles of the cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio , which is an established biomarker of cholesterol absorption , were used to identify high and low cholesterol absorbers . RESULTS	A total of 454 primary endpoints occurred . RESULTS	On multivariate time-to-event analyses , the interaction term between tertiles and treatment with atorvastatin was significantly associated with the risk of reaching the primary endpoint . RESULTS	Stratified analysis by cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio tertiles confirmed this effect modification : atorvastatin reduced the risk of reaching the primary endpoint in the first tertile ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 0.72 ; p = 0.049 ) , but not the second ( HR : 0.79 ; p = 0.225 ) or third tertiles ( HR : 1.21 ; p = 0.287 ) . RESULTS	Atorvastatin consistently significantly reduced all-cause mortality and the risk of all cardiac events in only the first tertile . CONCLUSIONS	Intestinal cholesterol absorption , as reflected by cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratios , predicts the effectiveness of atorvastatin to reduce cardiovascular risk in hemodialysis patients . CONCLUSIONS	Those with low cholesterol absorption appear to benefit from treatment with atorvastatin , whereas those with high absorption do not benefit ."
"OBJECTIVE	Metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) is generally an incurable disease with variable response to imatinib . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to develop prognostic nomograms to predict overall survival ( OS ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) for patients treated with imatinib . METHODS	Nomograms were developed in a training cohort ( n = 330 ) of patients treated in a randomised trial ( EORTC-ISG-AGITG 62005 phase III study ) using Cox regression models , and validated in patients ( n = 236 ) treated in routine clinical care from six referral centres . METHODS	Nomogram performance was assessed by calculating the c statistic . METHODS	A classification based on the nomograms ' scores was generated to group patients according to risk . RESULTS	Nomogram risk factors for OS and PFS were size of the largest metastasis , tumour genotype , primary tumour mitotic count , haemoglobin and blood neutrophil count at commencement of imatinib . RESULTS	The nomograms predicted survival with a c statistic of 0.75 ( training ) and 0.62 ( validation ) for OS , and 0.69 ( training ) and 0.62 ( validation ) for PFS . RESULTS	When tested in the validation cohort , the nomograms discriminated well the high and intermediate risk from low risk patients ( hazard ratio [ HR ] for OS 3.83 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.71-8 .56 ; and 2.48 , 95 % CI 1.12-5 .50 ; for PFS 2.84 , 95 % CI 1.66-4 .87 ; and 1.45 , 95 % CI 0.87-2 .41 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	The nomograms predicted the risk of GIST progression and death with good discrimination of risk groups , and may be of value for patient counselling and risk stratification ."
"OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the effects of colestilan , a non-absorbed anion-exchange resin , on lipids and lipoproteins in dialysis patients . METHODS	This randomized , double-blind , double-dummy , flexible-dose study incorporating a placebo-controlled withdrawal period tested for superiority vs. placebo and non-inferiority vs. simvastatin . METHODS	Dialysis patients with serum low-density lipoprotein ( LDL-C ) 100 mg/dL received colestilan 3 - 12 g/day or simvastatin 10 - 40 mg/day for 16 weeks , and were then re-randomized to continue active medication or receive placebo for 4 weeks . METHODS	Co-primary endpoints were the percent change in serum LDL-C level during the active and placebo comparison phases . RESULTS	Colestilan was non-inferior to simvastatin for lowering serum LDL-C ( mean changes -29.5 % vs. -28.9 % ; difference 0.6 % , 95 % CI -5.7 , 4.5 ) . RESULTS	Colestilan was more effective than placebo at maintaining control of serum LDL-C levels during the withdrawal phase ( mean change +4.4 % vs. +41.7 % ; difference -37.4 % ; p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Reductions in total cholesterol were similar with both drugs , but simvastatin was more effective at controlling triglyceride levels . RESULTS	Adverse events most commonly affected the gastrointestinal system . CONCLUSIONS	In dialysis patients , colestilan was more effective than placebo at maintaining control of serum LDL-C levels , was noninferior to simvastatin in terms of the reduction in LDL-C achieved , and was generally well tolerated ."
"OBJECTIVE	To explore the clinical effects of nimotuzumab combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of late gastric cancer . METHODS	A total of 34 reoccurrence or metastatic patients with late stage gastric cancer who were confirmed by histopathology and/or cytology were selected and randomly divided into observational and control groups , of 17 cases each . METHODS	Patients in the control group were treated with the standard DCF plan , while patients in observational group additionally received nimotuzumab . METHODS	The short-term and long-term efficacy and adverse reactions in the 2 groups were followed . RESULTS	The objective response rate ( ORR ) and disease control rate ( DCR ) were 64.7 % ( 11/17 ) and 82.4 % ( 14/17 ) in observational group and 25.0 % ( 4/16 ) and 37.5 % ( 6/16 ) in the control group ( ORR and DCR between 2 groups , 2 = 5.2412 , P = 0.0221 and 2 = 6.9453 , P = 0.0084 ) . RESULTS	The median progression-free survival ( PFS ) time and median overall survival ( OS ) time were 6.50 months and 12.50 months in observational group and 4.50 months and 8.25 months in the control group ( P = 0.0212 ; P = 0.0255 ) . RESULTS	The main toxic and side effects in the 2 groups were reduced leukocytes and hemoglobin , gastrointestinal reactions and hair loss and these were relieved after symptomatic treatment and nutrition support therapy . RESULTS	There were no differences in the occurrence of toxic and side effects between the 2 groups . CONCLUSIONS	Nimotuzumab combined with DCF plan is effective in treating late stage gastric cancer . CONCLUSIONS	A larger scale study is now warranted for confirmation of the findings ."
"BACKGROUND	This pilot study investigates the efficacy of a probiotic consortium ( Lab4 ) in combination with vitamin C on the prevention of respiratory tract infections in children attending preschool facilities . METHODS	In a double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled pilot study with children aged 3-6 years , 57 received 1.25 10 ( 10 ) colony-forming units of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL21 ( NCIMB 30156 ) , Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 ( NCIMB 30157 ) , Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 ( NCIMB 30153 ) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . METHODS	lactis CUL34 ( NCIMB 30172 ) plus 50mg vitamin C or a placebo daily for 6 months . RESULTS	Significant reductions in the incidence rate of upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ; 33 % , P = 0.002 ) , the number of days with URTI symptoms ( mean difference : -21.0 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : -35.9 , -6.0 , P = 0.006 ) and the incidence rate of absence from preschool ( 30 % , P = 0.007 ) were observed in the active group compared with the placebo . RESULTS	The number of days of use of antibiotics , painkillers , cough medicine or nasal sprays was lower in the active group and reached significance for use of cough medicine ( mean difference : -6.6 , 95 % CI : -12.9 , -0.3 , P = 0.040 ) . RESULTS	No significant differences were observed in the incidence rate ratio or duration of lower respiratory tract infection or in the levels of plasma cytokines , salivary immunoglobulin A or urinary metabolites . CONCLUSIONS	Supplementation with a probiotic/vitamin C combination may be beneficial in the prevention and management of URTIs ."
"BACKGROUND	Targeting a single pathway in pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PC ) is unlikely to affect its natural history . BACKGROUND	We tested the hypothesis that simulataneous targeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 ( IGF-1R ) pathways would significantly improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) by abrogating reciprocal signaling that promote drug resistance METHODS	This was a phase Ib/II study testing cixutumumab , combined with erlotinib and gemcitabine ( G ) in patients with untreated metastatic PC . METHODS	The control arm was erlotinib plus G. METHODS	The primary end point was PFS . METHODS	Eligibility included performance status 0/1 and normal fasting blood glucose . METHODS	Polymorphisms in genes involved in G metabolism and in the EGFR pathway were also studied RESULTS	The phase I results ( n = 10 ) established the safety of cixutumumab 6 mg/kg/week intravenously , erlotinib 100 mg/day orally , and G 1000 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously on days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 28-day cycle . RESULTS	In the RP2 portion ( 116 eligible patients ; median age , 63 ) , the median PFS and overall survival ( OS ) were 3.6 and 7.0 months , respectively , on the cixutumumab arm , and 3.6 and 6.7 months , respecively , on the control arm . RESULTS	Major grades 3 and 4 toxicities with cixutumumab and control were elevation of transaminases , 12 % and 6 % , respectively ; fatigue , 16 % and 12 % , respectively ; gastrointestinal , 35 % and 28 % , respectively ; neutropenia , 21 % and 10 % , respectively ; and thrombocytopenia , 16 % and 7 % , respecively . RESULTS	Grade 3/4 hyperglycemia was seen in 16 % of patients on cixutumumab . RESULTS	Grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity was similar in both arms of the study ( < 5 % ) . RESULTS	No significant differences in PFS by genotype were seen for any of the polymorphisms . CONCLUSIONS	Adding the IGF-1R inhibitor cixutumumab to erlotinib and G did not lead to longer PFS or OS in metastatic PC ."
"BACKGROUND	The use of low-dose aspirin ( LDA ) has emerged as an important cause of gastrointestinal ulcers . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the association between LDA-induced gastric mucosal injury and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and cell apoptosis in elderly Chinese patients . METHODS	A total of 136 patients aged 60 to 80 years with LDA-induced ( 100 mg/d for at least 1 month ) gastric mucosal injury and 48 age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study . METHODS	The patients were divided into a low-severity group and a high-severity group based on their modified Lanza scale scores . METHODS	Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa from all participants were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for VEGF expression and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining for cell apoptosis . METHODS	Staining indices and apoptotic indices were applied to assess VEGF expression level and the extent of cell apoptosis . RESULTS	VEGF expression decreased significantly in the 2 patient groups , whereas the extent of cell apoptosis significantly increased compared with the control group . RESULTS	Furthermore , Spearman 's correlation coefficients suggest that VEGF expression levels and the extent of cell apoptosis in gastric mucosae shared a significant correlation with the severity of LDA-induced gastric mucosal injury . RESULTS	Receiver operating characteristics analysis further confirmed these results . CONCLUSIONS	Our findings provide important clues as to the underlying molecular mechanism behind gastric mucosal injury resulting from exposure to LDA in elderly adults , and also suggest that interventions specifically targeting the pathways associated with angiogenesis and apoptosis may help facilitate the healing process ."
"OBJECTIVE	Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) treatment relies on tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , but their use can be associated with low-grade adverse events ( AEs ) . OBJECTIVE	This analysis aimed to identify the low-grade AEs which significantly impact the Health Related Quality of Life ( HRQoL ) of CML patients in chronic phase ( CP ) and to compare the incidence of such AEs among nilotinib - and imatinib-treated patients . METHODS	Data from the 48 month ENESTnd trial were used ( N = 593 patients ) . METHODS	HRQoL was assessed using generic ( SF-36 ) and leukemia-specific ( FACT-Leu ) HRQoL surveys . METHODS	AEs were categorized into 26 system organ classes . RESULTS	In the adjusted regression model , five low-grade AE categories - gastrointestinal disorders , blood and lymphatic system disorders , general disorders and administration site conditions , musculoskeletal disorders , and psychiatric disorders - significantly impaired at least one HRQoL score . RESULTS	The incidence rate of these five AE categories was either significantly lower for nilotinib than imatinib or not different between the two drugs . RESULTS	The AE categories with lower incidence for both nilotinib 300mg BID and 400mg BID versus imatinib 400mg daily were gastrointestinal , blood and lymphatic system , and musculoskeletal ; nilotinib 300mg BID had lower incidence than imatinib for general disorders . CONCLUSIONS	Low-grade AEs were grouped and analyzed by system organ class category , so the effect of some rare individual AEs on HRQoL may have been missed . CONCLUSIONS	The impact of low-grade AEs on HRQoL should be taken into account , along with other factors , when selecting the optimal treatment for patients newly diagnosed with CML-CP ."
"BACKGROUND	Benefits of recombinant human growth hormone ( rhGH ) alone or combined with glutamine in patients with intestinal failure because of short-bowel syndrome remain controversial . OBJECTIVE	We explored effects of rhGH on whole-body protein metabolism in patients with short-bowel syndrome with intestinal failure ( SBS-IF ) to gain insight into its mechanism of action . METHODS	Eight stable hyperphagic patients with severe SBS-IF received , in a double-blind , randomized crossover study , low-dose rhGH ( 0.05 mg kg d ) and a placebo for two 3-wk periods . METHODS	Leucine and glutamine kinetics under fasting and fed conditions , fat-free mass ( FFM ) , and serum insulin were determined on the final day of each treatment . RESULTS	rhGH increased FFM and nonoxidative leucine disposal ( NOLD ; an index of protein synthesis ) ( P < 0.02 ) , whereas FFM and NOLD were correlated in the fed state ( r = 0.81 , P = 0.015 ) . RESULTS	With rhGH administration , leucine release from protein breakdown ( an index of proteolysis ) decreased in the fed compared with fasting states ( P = 0.012 ) , which was not observed with the placebo . RESULTS	However , the fast-to-fed difference in leucine release from protein breakdown was not significantly different between rhGH and placebo ( P = 0.093 ) . RESULTS	With rhGH , the intestinal absorption of leucine and glutamine increased ( P = 0.036 ) and correlated with serum insulin ( r = 0.91 , P = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	rhGH increased glutamine de novo synthesis ( P < 0.02 ) and plasma concentrations ( P < 0.03 ) in both fasting and fed states . CONCLUSIONS	In SBS-IF patients , feeding fails to decrease proteolysis in contrast to what is physiologically observed in healthy subjects . CONCLUSIONS	rhGH enhances FFM through the stimulation of protein synthesis and might decrease proteolysis in response to feeding . CONCLUSIONS	Improvements in de novo synthesis and intestinal absorption increase glutamine availability over the physiologic range , suggesting that beneficial effects of rhGH in hyperphagic patients might be achieved without glutamine supplementation ."
"BACKGROUND	Both the amount and the rate of absorption of ethanol ( EtOH ) from alcoholic beverages are key determinants of the peak blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) and exposure of organs other than gut and liver . BACKGROUND	Previous studies suggest EtOH is absorbed more rapidly in the fasting than in the postprandial state . BACKGROUND	The concentration of EtOH and the type of beverage may determine gastric emptying/absorption of EtOH . METHODS	The pharmacokinetics of EtOH were measured in 15 healthy men after consumption of 0.5 g of EtOH/kg body weight . METHODS	During this 3-session crossover study , subjects consumed in separate sessions , beer ( 5.1 % v/v ) , white wine ( 12.5 % v/v ) , or vodka/tonic ( 20 % v/v ) over 20 minutes following an overnight fast . METHODS	BAC was measured by gas chromatography at multiple points after consumption . RESULTS	Peak BAC ( Cmax ) was significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) after vodka/tonic ( 77.4 17.0 mg/dl ) than after wine ( 61.7 10.8 mg/dl ) or beer ( 50.3 9.8 mg/dl ) and was significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) after wine than beer . RESULTS	The time to Cmax occurred significantly earlier ( p < 0.01 ) after vodka/tonic ( 36 10 minutes ) compared to wine ( 54 14 minutes ) or beer ( 62 23 minutes ) . RESULTS	Six subjects exceeded a Cmax of 80 mg/dl after vodka/tonic , but none exceeded this limit after beer or wine . RESULTS	The area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) was significantly greater after drinking vodka/tonic ( p < 0.001 ) than after wine or beer . RESULTS	Comparison of AUCs indicated the relative bioavailability of EtOH was lower after drinking beer . CONCLUSIONS	Findings indicate that BAC is higher after drinking vodka/tonic than beer or wine after fasting . CONCLUSIONS	A binge pattern is significantly more likely to result in BAC above 80 mg/dl after drinking vodka/tonic than beer or wine . CONCLUSIONS	Men drinking on an empty stomach should know BAC will vary depending on beverage type and the rate and amount of EtOH ."
"BACKGROUND	Chemoradiotherapy ( CHRT ) is often advocated for locally-advanced biliary tract cancer ( LABTC ) . BACKGROUND	However there was not comparative study with chemotherapy alone ( CH ) . METHODS	Patients with hilar or extrahepatic non-metastatic , LABTC could be included in this phase II trial . METHODS	The inclusion criteria required World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 2 , bilirubinemia 50 M/L after biliary drainage if necessary , and possibility of external radiotherapy . METHODS	Fluorouracil ( 5 FU ) infusion and cisplatin , were given in association to radiotherapy ( 50 Gy ) in the CHRT arm . METHODS	Gemcitabine + oxaliplatin ( GEMOX ) was planned for 6 months in the CH arm . METHODS	End-points were progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , toxicity and rate of biliary complications . RESULTS	The trial was closed before completion due to slow recruitment . RESULTS	Eighteen and 16 patients were included in the CHRT and CH arms , respectively . RESULTS	Median follow up was 27.9 months ( 2.8 ) . RESULTS	Grade III-IV toxicities were mostly haematological ( 23 % and 25 % ) , and gastrointestinal ( 11 % and 6 % ) , in the CHRT and CH arm , respectively . RESULTS	Biliary complications occurred in 28 % of patients in the CHRT arm and 44 % of patients in the CH arm ( risk ratio ( RR ) : 1.60 [ 0.65-3 .92 ] ) . RESULTS	Median PFS was 5.8 months in the CHRT group and 11.0 months in the CH group ( hazard ratio ( HR ) : 0.65 [ 0.32-1 .33 ] ) . RESULTS	Median OS was 13.5 months in the CHRT group and 19.9 months in the CH group ( HR : 0.69 [ 0.31-1 .55 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	Combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin seems to be at least as efficient as chemoradiotherapy ( 50 Gy plus 5 FU and cisplatin ) in LABTC ."
"OBJECTIVE	The study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 strain supplementation in patients suffering from systemic nickel allergy syndrome , in terms of modulation of faecal LAB population linked to a reduction of GI and cutaneous symptoms and to an increase of patient 's quality of life . RESULTS	A preliminary double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study was planned and a culture-independent method based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) analysis coupled to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing was applied to investigate on the dynamics of faecal LAB communities before and during a low-Ni diet , supplemented with the probiotic strain . RESULTS	Moreover , the severity and the frequency of GI and cutaneous reactions as well as patient 's clinical condition perception ( VAS scores ) were estimated by statistical analysis . RESULTS	PCR-DGGE fingerprinting obtained using LAB-specific primers revealed significant shift in faecal community with an increase in biodiversity in patients supplemented with probiotic Lact.reuteri strain . RESULTS	In addition , GI reactions such as symptoms related to meals and type of stools significantly improved only in patients treated with Lact.reuteri , while severity and frequency of cutaneous symptoms ( urticaria , itch and eczema ) and recurrent abdominal pain ( RAP ) as well as VAS scores statistically decreased in both groups . CONCLUSIONS	Our preliminary findings suggest that probiotic Lact.reuteri could be a useful supplementation during a low-Ni diet of patients with SNAS , to increase LAB population diversity , which could contribute to restore the intestinal homoeostasis conditions . CONCLUSIONS	To date , no information is available on probiotics application and on their effects , in terms of intestinal microbiota modulation , on patients suffering from SNAS . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , the identification of dominant LAB community and the study of its shift during the probiotic supplementation could enhance the knowledge of the SNAS syndrome ."
"BACKGROUND	The incidence and severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) in Japan tends to increase in elderly women . BACKGROUND	Rikkunshito ( RKT ) , a traditional Japanese medicine , acts as a prokinetic agent and improves gastric emptying and gastric accommodation . BACKGROUND	Our previous prospective randomized placebo-controlled study showed that RKT combined with a standard-dose of rabeprazole ( RPZ ) significantly improved the acid-related dysmotility symptoms ( ARD ) in elderly patients with proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) - refractory non-erosive reflux disease ( NERD ) . BACKGROUND	This study aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics of elderly PPI-refractory NERD patients with ARD symptoms who responded to RKT . METHODS	Two hundred forty-two patients with PPI-refractory NERD were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of either RPZ ( 10 mg/q . METHODS	d. ) + RKT ( 7.5 g/t . METHODS	i.d. ) ( RKT group ) or RPZ + placebo ( PL group ) . METHODS	Among them , 95 were elderly ( 65 years ) with ARD ( RKT group : n = 52 ; PL group : n = 43 ) . METHODS	We analyzed the changes using the 12 subscale score of frequency scale for the symptoms of GERD ( FSSG ) and 15 items of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at 4 and 8 weeks and compared the therapeutic efficacy between the 2 groups . RESULTS	There were no marked differences in baseline demographic or clinical characteristics in the 2 groups except for rate of current smoking . RESULTS	The FSSG score ( mean SD at 0 , 4 , and 8 weeks ) in both the RKT ( 16.0 7.0 ; 9.9 8.4 ; 7.0 6.4 ) and PL ( 15.1 6.4 ; 10.9 6.7 , 11.1 8.5 ) groups significantly decreased after treatment . RESULTS	However , the degree of improvement of total and ARD scores of FSSG after the 8-week treatment was significantly greater in the RKT group than in the PL group . RESULTS	Combination therapy with RKT for 8 weeks showed significant improvement in 3 subscale scores ( abdominal bloating , heavy feeling in stomach and sick feeling after meals ) of the ARD domain and 1 subscale score ( heartburn after meals ) of the reflux symptom domain . CONCLUSIONS	RKT may be useful for improving GERD symptoms in elderly PPI-refractory NERD patients with ARD .

BACKGROUND	It may provide added benefit in treating or preventing bacterial infections that occur in children with malaria . OBJECTIVE	We aim to evaluate the effect of treating clinical malaria with chloroquine-azithromycin on the incidence of respiratory-tract and gastrointestinal-tract infections compared to treatment with chloroquine monotherapy . METHODS	We compared the incidence density and time to first events of respiratory-tract and gastrointestinal-tract infections among children assigned to receive chloroquine-azithromycin or chloroquine for all symptomatic malaria episodes over the course of 1 year in a randomized longitudinal trial in Blantyre , Malawi . RESULTS	The incidence density ratios of total respiratory-tract infections and gastrointestinal-tract infections comparing chloroquine-azithromycin to chloroquine monotherapy were 0.67 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , .48 , .94 ) and 0.74 ( 95 % CI , .55 , .99 ) , respectively . RESULTS	The time to first lower-respiratory-tract and gastrointestinal-tract infections were significantly longer in the chloroquine-azithromycin arm compared to the chloroquine arm ( P = .04 and P = .02 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	Children treated routinely with chloroquine-azithromycin had fewer respiratory and gastrointestinal-tract infections than those treated with chloroquine alone . CONCLUSIONS	This antimalarial combination has the potential to reduce the burden of bacterial infections among children in malaria-endemic countries ."
"BACKGROUND	The vaginal microbiota may play a role in mediating susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections , including Trichomonas vaginalis ( TV ) . METHODS	Data were analyzed from HIV-1-seronegative women participating in HIV Prevention Trials Network Protocol 035 . METHODS	At quarterly visits for up to 30 months , participants completed structured interviews and specimens were collected for genital tract infection testing . METHODS	T. vaginalis was detected by saline microscopy . METHODS	Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) was characterized by Gram stain using the Nugent score ( BV = 7-10 ; intermediate = 4-6 ; normal = 0-3 [ reference group ] ) . METHODS	Cox proportional hazards models stratified by study site were used to assess the association between Nugent score category at the prior quarterly visit and TV acquisition . RESULTS	In this secondary analysis , 2920 participants from Malawi , South Africa , United States , Zambia , and Zimbabwe contributed 16,259 follow-up visits . RESULTS	Bacterial vaginosis was detected at 5680 ( 35 % ) visits , and TV was detected at 400 ( 2.5 % ) visits . RESULTS	Adjusting for age , marital status , hormonal contraceptive use , unprotected sex in the last week and TV at baseline , intermediate Nugent score , and BV at the prior visit were associated with an increased risk of TV ( intermediate score : adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] , 1.73 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.21-2 .19 ; BV : aHR , 2.40 ; 95 % CI , 1.92-3 .00 ) . RESULTS	Sensitivity analyses excluding 211 participants with TV at baseline were similar to those from the full study population ( intermediate score : aHR , 1.54 ; 95 % CI , 1.10-2 .14 ; BV : aHR , 2.23 ; 95 % CI , 1.75-2 .84 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Women with a Nugent score higher than 3 were at an increased risk for acquiring TV . CONCLUSIONS	If this relationship is causal , interventions that improve the vaginal microbiota could contribute to reductions in TV incidence ."
"OBJECTIVE	Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a chronic , relapsing and remitting intestinal inflammatory disorder . OBJECTIVE	Zinc is known to be efficacious for the repair of damaged tissue and has been shown to protect against gastric ulceration . OBJECTIVE	This study focused on Polaprezinc ( PZ ) , N - ( 3-aminopropionyl ) - L-histidinato zinc , which accelerates ulcer healing through actions such as prostaglandin-independent cytoprotection and antioxidative activity . METHODS	In this randomized , placebo-controlled , investigator-blinded trial , 28 patients with active UC at The Jikei University Hospital were randomly divided into two groups : one treated with a 150 mg PZ enema ( n = 18 ) and the other not treated with a PZ enema ( n = 10 ) . METHODS	All patients received usual induction therapy . METHODS	Clinical symptoms , endoscopic findings and histological findings were evaluated at entry and one week later . RESULTS	In the PZ group , modified Matts ' endoscopic scores were significantly improved after treatment compared to baseline in the rectum ( p = 0.004 ) , sigmoid colon ( p = 0.03 ) and descending colon ( p = 0.04 ) . RESULTS	In the non-PZ group , scores were not significantly improved in the rectum ( p = 0.14 ) and descending colon ( p = 0.34 ) , but were improved in the sigmoid colon ( p = 0.04 ) . RESULTS	In the PZ group , the Mayo scores at baseline and at Day 8 were 9.1 1.6 and 5.8 2.7 ( p = 0.00004 ) , respectively , and in the placebo group , the scores were 8.9 1.7 and 7.4 2.1 ( p = 0.009 ) , respectively . RESULTS	Clinical response or remission was significantly better in the PZ group ( 71 % ) than in the placebo group ( 10 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	A zinc-carnosine chelate compound , PZ , enema may become a useful new add-on treatment to accelerate mucosal healing in UC ."
"OBJECTIVE	Both metformin and acarbose are recommended monotherapy and add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . OBJECTIVE	A fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) of acarbose and metformin has been developed to reduce pill burden and potentially improve compliance . OBJECTIVE	The current study investigated the bioequivalence of the acarbose/metformin FDC compared with the individual agents administered simultaneously ( loose combination ) . OBJECTIVE	Secondary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the FDC and the potential for drug-drug interactions between acarbose and metformin . METHODS	A single-centre , randomized , open-label , four-period crossover study was conducted in healthy male Korean subjects aged 18-45years . METHODS	Following one-period balanced Williams design , participants were randomized to receive four single oral treatments on different study days separated by 7days ' washout . METHODS	Treatments were as follows : ( i ) acarbose/metformin 50/500mg FDC ( test ) ; ( ii ) acarbose 50mg and metformin 500mg as loose combination ( reference ) ; ( iii ) acarbose 50mg ; and ( iv ) metformin 500mg . METHODS	Serial blood samples were taken for glucose and insulin levels for 4h after a sucrose load on the day before and day of study drug administration . METHODS	Additionally , serial blood samples were taken for analysis of metformin levels for 24h after each drug containing metformin . METHODS	The area under the curve for 4h post-test ( AUC0-4h ) and the maximal serum concentration ( Cmax ) of plasma glucose and serum insulin were primary pharmacodynamic ( PD ) parameters , and Cmax , AUC0-last and AUC for metformin levels were primary pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters . METHODS	The bioequivalence of the FDC to the loose combination was considered established if the 90 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) of the baseline-adjusted PD parameter ratios ( test vs. reference ) for plasma glucose and the PK parameter ratios for metformin fell completely within current acceptance limits ( 08-125 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Thirty-three of 40 randomized subjects completed the study ; five withdrew consent and two discontinued because of adverse events ( AEs ) . CONCLUSIONS	The 24-h plasma concentration-time curves of metformin and the 4-h plasma glucose-time curves after acarbose/metformin FDC ( test ) and acarbose + metformin loose combination ( reference ) were almost superimposable . CONCLUSIONS	The geometric least squares ( LS ) mean of the RatioAUC and RatioCmax for plasma glucose after the FDC vs. loose combination , and the LS mean of the ratios in metformin AUC , AUC0-last and Cmax were close to unity , and the 90 % CI of all these parameters fell within the predefined equivalence range of 08-125 , confirming bioequivalence . CONCLUSIONS	The metformin AUC was reduced by 26 % and Cmax by 34 % after acarbose + metformin compared with metformin alone . CONCLUSIONS	Eight subjects ( 200 % ) reported AEs , but all were mild , and most were gastrointestinal , as expected for these agents . CONCLUSIONS	The incidence of AEs was not higher with the combinations vs. monotherapy . CONCLUSIONS	These data demonstrate that the acarbose/metformin FDC is bioequivalent to the loose combination of these agents . CONCLUSIONS	Although acarbose slightly reduced the bioavailability of metformin , the accumulated evidence of the efficacy of this combination implies that this is clinically irrelevant . CONCLUSIONS	The observed AE profile was consistent with the established knowledge on the safety of the two drugs ."
"OBJECTIVE	Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition predominantly seen in patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) inhibitors with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) who may also have diabetes , heart failure , or both . OBJECTIVE	To select starting doses for a phase 3 study and to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of a potassium-binding polymer , patiromer , in outpatients with hyperkalemia . METHODS	Phase 2 , multicenter , open-label , dose-ranging , randomized clinical trial ( AMETHYST-DN ) , conducted at 48 sites in Europe from June 2011 to June 2013 evaluating patiromer in 306 outpatients with type 2 diabetes ( estimated glomerular filtration rate , 15 to < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2 and serum potassium level > 5.0 mEq/L ) . METHODS	All patients received RAAS inhibitors prior to and during study treatment . METHODS	Patients were stratified by baseline serum potassium level into mild or moderate hyperkalemia groups and received 1 of 3 randomized starting doses of patiromer ( 4.2 g [ n = 74 ] , 8.4 g [ n = 74 ] , or 12.6 g [ n = 74 ] twice daily [ mild hyperkalemia ] or 8.4 g [ n = 26 ] , 12.6 g [ n = 28 ] , or 16.8 g [ n = 30 ] twice daily [ moderate hyperkalemia ] ) . METHODS	Patiromer was titrated to achieve and maintain serum potassium level 5.0 mEq/L or lower . METHODS	The primary efficacy end point was mean change in serum potassium level from baseline to week 4 or prior to initiation of dose titration . METHODS	The primary safety end point was adverse events through 52 weeks . METHODS	Secondary efficacy end points included mean change in serum potassium level through 52 weeks . RESULTS	A total of 306 patients were randomized . RESULTS	The least squares mean reduction from baseline in serum potassium level at week 4 or time of first dose titration in patients with mild hyperkalemia was 0.35 ( 95 % CI , 0.22-0 .48 ) mEq/L for the 4.2 g twice daily starting-dose group , 0.51 ( 95 % CI , 0.38-0 .64 ) mEq/L for the 8.4 g twice daily starting-dose group , and 0.55 ( 95 % CI , 0.42-0 .68 ) mEq/L for the 12.6 g twice daily starting-dose group . RESULTS	In those with moderate hyperkalemia , the reduction was 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.60-1 .14 ) mEq/L for the 8.4 g twice daily starting-dose group , 0.97 ( 95 % CI , 0.70-1 .23 ) mEq/L for the 12.6 g twice daily starting-dose group , and 0.92 ( 95 % CI , 0.67-1 .17 ) mEq/L for the 16.8 g twice daily starting-dose group ( P < .001 for all changes vs baseline by hyperkalemia starting-dose groups within strata ) . RESULTS	From week 4 through week 52 , statistically significant mean decreases in serum potassium levels were observed at each monthly point in patients with mild and moderate hyperkalemia . RESULTS	Over the 52 weeks , hypomagnesemia ( 7.2 % ) was the most common treatment-related adverse event , mild to moderate constipation ( 6.3 % ) was the most common gastrointestinal adverse event , and hypokalemia ( < 3.5 mEq/L ) occurred in 5.6 % of patients . CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with hyperkalemia and diabetic kidney disease , patiromer starting doses of 4.2 to 16.8 g twice daily resulted in statistically significant decreases in serum potassium level after 4 weeks of treatment , lasting through 52 weeks .

"OBJECTIVE	To investigate in this phase 2a study ( ZENITH ) the safety , tolerability , and antiviral activity of VX-222 , a selective , non-nucleoside inhibitor of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) NS5B polymerase , combined with various telaprevir-based regimens for treatment of genotype 1 HCV . METHODS	In total , 152 treatment-naive patients received VX-222 + telaprevir ( ` DUAL ' regimen ; n = 47 ) , with ribavirin ( ` TRIPLE ' regimen ; n = 46 ) , or with peginterferon + ribavirin ( ` QUAD ' regimen ; n = 59 ) for 12 weeks . METHODS	Patients with detectable HCV RNA at weeks 2 and/or 8 received peginterferon + ribavirin for 24 ( DUAL and TRIPLE ) or 12 ( QUAD ) additional weeks . RESULTS	VX-222 ( 100 or 400 mg twice daily ) was well tolerated , with an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events observed with the higher dose . RESULTS	Across VX-222 400-mg twice-daily regimens , the QUAD was associated with the highest frequency of grade 3/4 adverse events . RESULTS	The DUAL was discontinued because of high viral breakthrough before week 12 . RESULTS	Sustained virologic response ( SVR ) 24 weeks after end of treatment ( SVR24 ) , including patients treated with 12 or 24 additional weeks of peginterferon + ribavirin , was 67 % for TRIPLE ( VX-222 400 mg twice daily ) and 79 and 90 % for QUAD ( VX-222 100 and 400 mg twice daily , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	These results provide valuable information regarding the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of telaprevir combined with a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor , as dual therapy or with ribavirin without or with peginterferon . CONCLUSIONS	Telaprevir and VX-222 , alone or with ribavirin without or with peginterferon , were generally well tolerated , with improved tolerability without peginterferon . CONCLUSIONS	SVR24 rates achieved with TRIPLE and QUAD regimens containing telaprevir and VX-222 were comparable to those observed with telaprevir-based therapy ."

OBJECTIVE	Recent trials of probiotic use among healthy pregnant women demonstrate potential for improved glycemic control . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a probiotic capsule intervention on maternal metabolic parameters and pregnancy outcome among women with gestational diabetes . METHODS	This double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trialrecruited pregnant women with a new diagnosis of gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance following a 3-hour 100-g glucose tolerance test . METHODS	Women were randomized to a daily probiotic ( Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 ) or placebo capsule from diagnosis until delivery . METHODS	Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and 4-6 weeks after capsule commencement for analysis of glucose , insulin , c-peptide , and lipids . METHODS	The primary outcome was difference in fasting glucose postintervention , first analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and followed by per-protocol analysis that excluded women commenced on pharmacological therapy ( insulin or metformin ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were changes in insulin , c-peptide , homeostasis model assessment and lipids , requirement for pharmacological therapy , and neonatal anthropometry . RESULTS	Of 149 women recruited and randomized , there were nodifferences between the probiotic and placebo groups in postintervention fasting glucose ( 4.65 0.49 vs 4.65 0.53 mmol/L ; P = 373 ) , requirement for pharmacological therapy ( 17 % vs 14 % ; P = .643 ) , or birthweight ( 3.57 0.64 vs 3.60 0.57 kg ; P = .845 ) . RESULTS	Among 100 women managed with diet and exercise alone , fastingplasma glucose decreased significantly within both the probiotic ( 4.76 0.45 to 4.57 0.42 mmol/L ; P < .001 ) and placebo ( 4.85 0.58 to 4.58 0.45 mmol/L ; P < .001 ) groups , but the levels between groups did not differ ( P = .316 ) .

"OBJECTIVE	To assess whether adding clopidogrel to acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) has a long-term protective vascular effect in patients with lacunar stroke while taking ASA . METHODS	Post hoc analysis of 838 patients with ASA failure and recent lacunar stroke from the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes Trial ( SPS3 ) cohort randomly allocated to aspirin ( 325 mg/day ) and clopidogrel ( 75 mg/day ) or placebo . METHODS	Primary efficacy outcome was stroke recurrence ( ischemic and intracranial hemorrhage ) and main safety outcome was major extracranial hemorrhage . METHODS	Patients were followed for a mean period of 3.5 years . RESULTS	The ASA failure group had a significantly higher risk of vascular events including ischemic stroke when compared with the non-ASA failure group ( n = 2,151 ) in SPS3 ( p = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	Mean age was 65.6 years and 65 % were men . RESULTS	The risk of recurrent stroke was not reduced in the dual antiplatelet group , 3.1 % per year , compared to the aspirin-only group , 3.3 % per year ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0.91 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.61-1 .37 ) . RESULTS	There was also no difference between groups for ischemic stroke ( HR 0.90 ; 95 % CI 0.59-1 .38 ) . RESULTS	The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher in the dual antiplatelet group ( HR 2.7 ; 95 % CI 1.1-6 .9 ) ; however , the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was not different . CONCLUSIONS	In patients with a recent lacunar stroke while taking ASA , the addition of clopidogrel did not result in reduction of vascular events vs continuing ASA only . METHODS	This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with recent lacunar stroke while taking ASA , adding clopidogrel as compared to continuing ASA alone does not reduce the risk of recurrent stroke ."

"OBJECTIVE	Clinical benefit response ( CBR ) , based on changes in pain , Karnofsky performance status , and weight , is an established palliative endpoint in trials for advanced gastrointestinal cancer . OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether CBR is associated with survival , and whether CBR reflects a wide-enough range of domains to adequately capture patients ' perception . METHODS	CBR was prospectively evaluated in an international phase III chemotherapy trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer ( n = 311 ) in parallel with patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) . RESULTS	The median time to treatment failure was 3.4 months ( range : 0-6 ) . RESULTS	The majority of the CBRs ( n = 39 ) were noted in patients who received chemotherapy for at least 5 months . RESULTS	Patients with CBR ( n = 62 ) had longer survival than non-responders ( n = 182 ) ( hazard ratio = 0.69 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.51-0 .94 ; p = 0.013 ) . RESULTS	CBR was predicted with a sensitivity and specificity of 77-80 % by various combinations of 3 mainly physical PROs . RESULTS	A comparison between the duration of CBR ( n = 62 , median = 8 months , range = 4-31 ) and clinically meaningful improvements in the PROs ( n = 100-116 ; medians = 9-11 months , range = 4-24 ) showed similar intervals . CONCLUSIONS	CBR is associated with survival and mainly reflects physical domains . CONCLUSIONS	Within phase III chemotherapy trials for advanced gastrointestinal cancer , CBR can be replaced by a PRO evaluation , without losing substantial information but gaining complementary information ."
"OBJECTIVE	Multidose steroid pretreatment is effective in preventing postextubation airway obstruction ( PEAO ) in adults , however controversy continues for children . OBJECTIVE	This study was designed as a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial to compare the effect of 24-h pretreatment with dexamethasone ( 24hPD ) versus 6-h pretreatment ( 6hPD ) on PEAO and reintubation in children at a tertiary care hospital in a developing economy . METHODS	Hundred twenty-four children ( 3 months to 12 years ) intubated for 48 h and planned to have extubation during next 24 h were randomized to receive 24hPD ( 0.5 mg/kg/dose , q6h , total of six doses ; n = 66 ) or 6hPD ( total of three doses ; n = 58 ) . METHODS	Patients with preexistent upper airway conditions , chronic respiratory diseases , steroid therapy in last 7 days , gastrointestinal bleeding , hypertension , and hyperglycemia and those likely to have poor airway reflexes were excluded . RESULTS	The two groups were similar at baseline . RESULTS	24hPD reduced the incidence of PEAO ( 43/66 versus 48/58 ; p = 0.027 ) with absolute risk reduction of 17 % . RESULTS	It also reduced the incidence of reintubation , though nonsignificantly , by half [ 5/61 versus 9/58 ; relative risk ( RR ) , 1.09 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.96-1 .25 ] . RESULTS	Time to recovery from PEAO among non-reintubated patients was shorter among 24hPD patients ( p = 0.016 ) . RESULTS	No adverse event was noted with dexamethasone use . RESULTS	Intubation duration > 7 days and cuffed tracheal tubes were found to be independent risk factors for PEAO ( odds ratio 6 and 3.12 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	24-h pretreatment with multidose dexamethasone reduced the incidence of PEAO and the time to recover from it . CONCLUSIONS	24hPD should be considered for high-risk children intubated for > 48 h in the study setting . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies with larger sample size from different socioeconomic background are desirable to validate these findings ."
"BACKGROUND	JTT-751 is a novel phosphate binder containing ferric citrate as the active ingredient . METHODS	In this Phase 3 , multicenter , randomized , open-label , parallel-group study , we compared the efficacy and safety of JTT-751 and sevelamer hydrochloride in patients undergoing hemodialysis . METHODS	A total of 230 patients with a serum phosphate 1.97 and < 3.23 mmol/L were randomized to JTT-751 ( dose adjusted between 1.5 and 6.0 g/day ) or sevelamer hydrochloride ( dose adjusted between 3.0 and 9.0 g/day ) for 12 weeks . METHODS	The primary outcome was change in serum phosphate from baseline to end of treatment . METHODS	Secondary outcomes included the changes in corrected serum calcium and intact parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . METHODS	The changes in ferritin , transferrin saturation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose were additional outcomes . RESULTS	Changes in serum phosphate at the end of treatment were -0.82 mmol/L in the JTT-751 group and -0.78 mmol/L in the sevelamer group , establishing non-inferiority of JTT-751 compared with sevelamer ( least squares mean , -0.03 mmol/L ; 95 % confidence interval , -0.13 to 0.07 mmol/L ) . RESULTS	Corrected serum calcium increased and PTH decreased from baseline within both groups ; changes between groups were similar . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events in both groups ; the incidence of diarrhea was higher in the JTT-751 group , while constipation occurred frequently in the sevelamer group .

"OBJECTIVE	Gastroparesis is a well-known complication to diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . OBJECTIVE	Dietary advice is considered to be of importance to reduce gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms in patients with diabetic gastroparesis , but no randomized controlled trials exist . OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to compare GI symptoms in insulin treated DM subjects with gastroparesis eating a diet with small particle size ( `` intervention diet '' ) with the recommended diet for DM ( `` control diet '' ) . METHODS	56 subjects with insulin treated DM and gastroparesis were randomized to the intervention diet or the control diet . METHODS	The patients received dietary advice by a dietitian at 7 occasions during 20 weeks . METHODS	GI symptom severity , nutrient intake and glycemic control were measured before and after the intervention . RESULTS	A significantly greater reduction of the severity of the key gastroparetic symptoms-nausea/vomiting ( P = 0.01 ) , postprandial fullness ( P = 0.02 ) and bloating ( P = 0.006 ) - were seen in patients who received the intervention diet compared with the control diet , and this was also true for regurgitation/heartburn ( P = 0.02 ) , but not for abdominal pain . RESULTS	Anxiety was reduced after the intervention diet , but not after the control diet , whereas no effect on depression or quality of life was noted in any of the groups . RESULTS	A higher fat intake in the intervention group was noted , but otherwise no differences in body weight , HbA1c or nutrient intake were seen . CONCLUSIONS	A small particle diet improves the key symptoms of gastroparesis in patients with diabetes mellitus . CONCLUSIONS	( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01557296 ) ."

"OBJECTIVE	To compare safety and efficacy of insulin glargine and liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . METHODS	This randomized , multinational , open-label trial included subjects treated for T2DM with metforminsulphonylurea , who had glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels of 7.5-12 % . METHODS	Subjects were assigned to 24weeks of insulin glargine , titrated to target fasting plasma glucose of 4.0-5 .5 mmol/L or liraglutide , escalated to the highest approved clinical dose of 1.8 mg daily . METHODS	The trial was powered to detect superiority of glargine over liraglutide in percentage of people reaching HbA1c < 7 % . RESULTS	The mean [ standard deviation ( s.d. ) ] age of the participants was 57 ( 9 ) years , the duration of diabetes was 9 ( 6 ) years , body mass index was 31.9 ( 4.2 ) kg/m ( 2 ) and HbA1c level was 9.0 ( 1.1 ) % . RESULTS	Equal numbers ( n = 489 ) were allocated to glargine and liraglutide . RESULTS	Similar numbers of subjects in both groups attained an HbA1c level of < 7 % ( 48.4 vs. 45.9 % ) ; therefore , superiority of glargine over liraglutide was not observed ( p = 0.44 ) . RESULTS	Subjects treated with glargine had greater reductions of HbA1c [ -1.94 % ( 0.05 ) and -1.79 % ( 0.05 ) ; p = 0.019 ] and fasting plasma glucose [ 6.2 ( 1.6 ) and 7.9 ( 2.2 ) mmol/L ; p < 0.001 ] than those receiving liraglutide . RESULTS	The liraglutide group reported a greater number of gastrointestinal treatment-emergent adverse events ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The mean ( s.d. ) weight change was +2.0 ( 4.0 ) kg for glargine and -3.0 ( 3.6 ) kg for liraglutide ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was more common with glargine ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	A greater number of subjects in the liraglutide arm withdrew as a result of adverse events ( p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Adding either insulin glargine or liraglutide to subjects with poorly controlled T2DM reduces HbA1c substantially , with nearly half of subjects reaching target levels of 7 % ."
"OBJECTIVE	Small trials suggest that postoperative outcomes may be improved by the use of cardiac output monitoring to guide administration of intravenous fluid and inotropic drugs as part of a hemodynamic therapy algorithm . OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a perioperative , cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm . METHODS	OPTIMISE was a pragmatic , multicenter , randomized , observer-blinded trial of 734 high-risk patients aged 50 years or older undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery at 17 acute care hospitals in the United Kingdom . METHODS	An updated systematic review and meta-analysis were also conducted including randomized trials published from 1966 to February 2014 . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm for intravenous fluid and inotrope ( dopexamine ) infusion during and 6 hours following surgery ( n = 368 ) or to usual care ( n = 366 ) . METHODS	The primary outcome was a composite of predefined 30-day moderate or major complications and mortality . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were morbidity on day 7 ; infection , critical care-free days , and all-cause mortality at 30 days ; all-cause mortality at 180 days ; and length of hospital stay . RESULTS	Baseline patient characteristics , clinical care , and volumes of intravenous fluid were similar between groups . RESULTS	Care was nonadherent to the allocated treatment for less than 10 % of patients in each group . RESULTS	The primary outcome occurred in 36.6 % of intervention and 43.4 % of usual care participants ( relative risk [ RR ] , 0.84 [ 95 % CI , 0.71-1 .01 ] ; absolute risk reduction , 6.8 % [ 95 % CI , -0.3 % to 13.9 % ] ; P = .07 ) . RESULTS	There was no significant difference between groups for any secondary outcomes . RESULTS	Five intervention patients ( 1.4 % ) experienced cardiovascular serious adverse events within 24 hours compared with none in the usual care group . RESULTS	Findings of the meta-analysis of 38 trials , including data from this study , suggest that the intervention is associated with fewer complications ( intervention , 488/1548 [ 31.5 % ] vs control , 614/1476 [ 41.6 % ] ; RR , 0.77 [ 95 % CI , 0.71-0 .83 ] ) and a nonsignificant reduction in hospital , 28-day , or 30-day mortality ( intervention , 159/3215 deaths [ 4.9 % ] vs control , 206/3160 deaths [ 6.5 % ] ; RR , 0.82 [ 95 % CI , 0.67-1 .01 ] ) and mortality at longest follow-up ( intervention , 267/3215 deaths [ 8.3 % ] vs control , 327/3160 deaths [ 10.3 % ] ; RR , 0.86 [ 95 % CI , 0.74-1 .00 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	In a randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery , use of a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm compared with usual care did not reduce a composite outcome of complications and 30-day mortality . CONCLUSIONS	However , inclusion of these data in an updated meta-analysis indicates that the intervention was associated with a reduction in complication rates .

"BACKGROUND	Ceftriaxone is the foundation of currently recommended gonorrhea treatment . BACKGROUND	There is an urgent need for backup treatment options for patients with cephalosporin allergy or infections due to suspected cephalosporin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae . BACKGROUND	We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of 2 combinations of existing noncephalosporin antimicrobials for treatment of patients with urogenital gonorrhea . METHODS	We conducted a randomized , multisite , open-label , noncomparative trial in 5 outpatient sexually transmitted disease clinic sites in Alabama , California , Maryland , and Pennsylvania . METHODS	Patients aged 15-60 years diagnosed with uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea were randomly assigned to either gentamicin 240 mg intramuscularly plus azithromycin 2 g orally , or gemifloxacin 320 mg orally plus azithromycin 2 g orally . METHODS	The primary outcome was microbiological cure of urogenital infections ( negative follow-up culture ) at 10-17 days after treatment among 401 participants in the per protocol population . RESULTS	Microbiological cure was achieved by 100 % ( lower 1-sided exact 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] bound , 98.5 % ) of 202 evaluable participants receiving gentamicin/azithromycin , and 99.5 % ( lower 1-sided exact 95 % CI bound , 97.6 % ) of 199 evaluable participants receiving gemifloxacin/azithromycin . RESULTS	Gentamicin/azithromycin cured 10 of 10 pharyngeal infections and 1 of 1 rectal infection ; gemifloxacin/azithromycin cured 15 of 15 pharyngeal and 5 of 5 rectal infections . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal adverse events were common in both arms . CONCLUSIONS	Gentamicin/azithromycin and gemifloxacin/azithromycin were highly effective for treatment of urogenital gonorrhea .

"BACKGROUND	Masitinib is a highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against the main oncogenic drivers of gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) . BACKGROUND	Masitinib was evaluated in patients with advanced GIST after imatinib failure or intolerance . METHODS	Prospective , multicenter , randomized , open-label trial . METHODS	Patients with inoperable , advanced imatinib-resistant GIST were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive masitinib ( 12 mg/kg/day ) or sunitinib ( 50 mg/day 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off ) until progression , intolerance , or refusal . METHODS	Primary efficacy analysis was noncomparative , testing whether masitinib attained a median progression-free survival ( PFS ) ( blind centrally reviewed RECIST ) threshold of > 3 months according to the lower bound of the 90 % unilateral confidence interval ( CI ) . METHODS	Secondary analyses on overall survival ( OS ) and PFS were comparative with results presented according to a two-sided 95 % CI . RESULTS	Forty-four patients were randomized to receive masitinib ( n = 23 ) or sunitinib ( n = 21 ) . RESULTS	Median follow-up was 14 months . RESULTS	Patients receiving masitinib experienced less toxicity than those receiving sunitinib , with significantly lower occurrence of severe adverse events ( 52 % versus 91 % , respectively , P = 0.008 ) . RESULTS	Median PFS ( central RECIST ) for the noncomparative primary analysis in the masitinib treatment arm was 3.71 months ( 90 % CI 3.65 ) . RESULTS	Secondary analyses showed that median OS was significantly longer for patients receiving masitinib followed by post-progression addition of sunitinib when compared against patients treated directly with sunitinib in second-line [ hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.09-0 .85 , P = 0.016 ] . RESULTS	This improvement was sustainable as evidenced by 26-month follow-up OS data ( HR = 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.16-0 .96 , P = 0.033 ) ; an additional 12.4 months survival advantage being reported for the masitinib treatment arm . RESULTS	Risk of progression while under treatment with masitinib was in the same range as for sunitinib ( HR = 1.1 , 95 % CI 0.6-2 .2 , P = 0.833 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Primary efficacy analysis ensured the masitinib treatment arm could satisfy a prespecified PFS threshold . CONCLUSIONS	Secondary efficacy analysis showed that masitinib followed by the standard of care generated a statistically significant survival benefit over standard of care . CONCLUSIONS	Encouraging median OS and safety data from this well-controlled and appropriately designed randomized trial indicate a positive benefit-risk ratio . CONCLUSIONS	Further development of masitinib in imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with advanced GIST is warranted ."

"BACKGROUND	Oral flora , blood-borne pathogens , and bacterial contamination pose a direct risk of infection to patients and health care workers . BACKGROUND	We conducted a study in a simulated operating room using a newly validated technology to determine whether the use of 2 sets of gloves , with the outer set removed immediately after endotracheal intubation , may reduce this risk . METHODS	Forty-one anesthesiology residents ( PGY 2-4 ) were enrolled in a study consisting of individual or group simulation sessions . METHODS	On entry to the simulated operating room , the residents were asked to perform an anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation timed to approximately 6 minutes ; they were unaware of the study design . METHODS	Of the 22 simulation sessions , 11 were conducted with the intubating resident wearing single gloves , and 11 with the intubating resident using double gloves with the outer pair removed after verified intubation . METHODS	Before the start of the scenario , we coated the lips and inside of the mouth of the mannequin with a fluorescent marking gel as a surrogate pathogen . METHODS	After the simulation , an observer examined 40 different sites using a handheld ultraviolet light in the operating room to determine the transfer of surrogate pathogens to the patient and the patient 's environment . METHODS	Residents who wore double gloves were instructed by a confederate nurse to remove the outer set immediately after completion of the intubation . METHODS	Forty sites of potential intraoperative pathogen spread were identified and assigned a score . RESULTS	The difference in the rate of contamination between anesthesiology residents who wore single gloves versus those with double gloves was clinically and statistically significant . RESULTS	The number of sites that were contaminated in the operating room when the intubating resident wore single gloves was 20.3 1.4 ( mean SE ) ; the number of contaminated sites when residents wore double gloves was 5.0 0.7 ( P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study suggest that when an anesthesiologist wears 2 sets of gloves during laryngoscopy and intubation and then removes the outer set immediately after intubation , the contamination of the intraoperative environment is dramatically reduced ."
"BACKGROUND	Data on the benefits of synbiotics in functional constipation are conflicting . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to assess whether the administration of the synbiotic supplement Psyllogel Megafermenti ( ) normalized stool consistency and decreased intestinal transit time ( ITT ) in patients with severe functional constipation , based on its ability to impact on the gut microbiota . METHODS	We conducted a pilot randomized , double-blind , controlled trial . METHODS	After a 2-week run-in period , patients from a tertiary care setting with severe functional constipation fulfilling the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria in the past year were randomly assigned to receive by mouth 2 bags/day of Psyllogel Megafermenti ( ) ( Group A ) or 2.8 g of maltodextrin twice daily ( Group B ) for 8 weeks . METHODS	Primary endpoints were increase of bowel evacuations with normal stool consistency and volume , and ITT reduction . METHODS	Secondary endpoints included symptom improvement according to the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria , reduction of the Agachan-Wexner score and changes in gut microbiota composition . RESULTS	Twenty-nine patients completed the study : 17 were allocated to Group A and 12 to Group B. RESULTS	A statistically significant increase in stools with normal consistency was observed only in Group A ( p = 0.001 ) , even when considering patients with normal stools 50 % of time at baseline . RESULTS	In Group A , a significant reduction in ITT was also found ( p = 0.022 ) . RESULTS	According to polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of stool samples , 50 % of the patients treated with synbiotics harbored all the probiotic species of the study product . CONCLUSIONS	An 8-week treatment with Psyllogel Megafermenti ( ) improved the main clinical parameters of functional constipation in patients extremely homogeneous for disorder severity and underlying pathophysiology ( Eudract.ema.europa.eu , No. 2008-000913-30 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Data on gastrointestinal ( GI ) side effects of bariatric surgery are limited because of incomplete reporting , cross-sectional samples , and nonstandardized assessments . OBJECTIVE	To report on GI side effects over the first 6 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) . METHODS	Academic medical center , United States . METHODS	One hundred forty-four patients completed a standardized clinical interview 6 months after operation , including questions on the occurrence and frequency of episodes of dumping syndrome , vomiting , and plugging for each of the past 6 months ; monthly rates were stable , so results were averaged over the entire period . METHODS	Although data were collected as part of a randomized controlled trial , randomization group and the interaction of group by surgical procedure were not related to GI side effects . METHODS	Thus , results are reported by procedure only ( RYGB , n = 87 ; LAGB , n = 56 ) . RESULTS	RYGB patients had a higher preoperative body mass index ( BMI ) than LAGB patients ( 46.86.8 versus 43.54.8 kg/m ( 2 ) , respectively ; P = .001 ) , were more likely to report dumping ( 45.7 % versus 4.7 % , P < .0001 ) , and were less likely to report plugging ( 45.7 % versus 79.1 % , P = .0005 ) . RESULTS	Vomiting did not differ significantly by procedure ( 68.6 % versus 65.1 % , P = .7 ) . RESULTS	Most patients experienced each GI side effect less than once per week . CONCLUSIONS	Although self-reported GI side effects were common over the first 6 months after operation , the frequency of episodes was relatively low . CONCLUSIONS	Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine whether symptoms worsen or improve over time ."
"OBJECTIVE	Patients with several painful functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGIDs ) are reported to have a high prevalence of psychosocial disturbance . OBJECTIVE	These aspects have not been studied extensively in patients with suspected Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction ( SOD ) . METHODS	A total of 214 patients with post-cholecystectomy pain and suspected SOD were enrolled in seven US centers in a multicenter-randomized trial ( Evaluating Predictors and Interventions in Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction ) . METHODS	Baseline assessments included pain descriptors and burden , structured psychosocial assessments of anxiety/depression , coping , trauma , and health-related quality of life . METHODS	Patients with high levels of depression , suicidal ideation , or psychosis were excluded . RESULTS	The study population ( 92 % female , mean age 38 ) reported anxiety ( 9 % ) , depression ( 8 % ) , past sexual trauma ( 18 % ) , and physical abuse ( 10 % ) . RESULTS	Of the total screened population ( n = 1460 ) , 3.9 % of the patients were excluded because of the presence of defined severe psychological problems . RESULTS	The mean medical outcomes study short-form-36 ( SF-36 ) physical and mental composite scores were 38.70 ( s.d. = 7.89 ) and 48.74 ( s.d. = 9.60 ) , respectively . RESULTS	Most subjects reported symptoms of other FGIDs . RESULTS	There were no correlations between the extent of the pain burden in the 3 months before enrollment and the baseline anxiety scores or victimization history . RESULTS	However , those with greater pain burden were significantly more depressed . RESULTS	There were no meaningful differences in the psychosocial parameters in subjects with or without irritable bowel , and those who had cholecystectomy for stones or functional gallbladder disease . RESULTS	Those declining randomization were comparable to those randomized . CONCLUSIONS	Psychosocial comorbidity in SOD is high . CONCLUSIONS	However , it does not appear to differ significantly from that reported in surveys of age - and gender-matched general populations , and may be lower than reported with other FGIDs ."

METHODS	We assessed B cell responses in participants in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation phase 1 study of the safety and immunogenicity of an intramuscular bivalent norovirus virus-like particle ( VLP ) vaccine . METHODS	The vaccine contained a GI .1 VLP ( Norwalk ) and a consensus GII .4 VLP , representing the two major genotypes that cause human disease , and was administered on days 0 and 28 to healthy adults aged 18-49 years . METHODS	Four separate cohorts received increasing doses of 5 g , 15 g , 50 g , and 150 g of each VLP adjuvanted in monophosphoryl lipid A and alum . METHODS	PBMCs were analyzed for B cell activation and mucosal homing markers ( flow cytometry ) and VLP-specific and total IgG and IgA Ab-secreting cells ( ASCs ) ; and serum titers of VLP-specific IgG , IgA , and Pan-Ig were determined . RESULTS	The vaccine elicited CD27 + CD38 + plasmablasts and high frequencies of ASCs specific for both VLP antigens in the peripheral blood at 7 days after the first dose . RESULTS	The plasmablasts exhibited a mucosal-homing phenotype and included a high proportion of IgA ASCs . RESULTS	Serum antibodies increased as early as 7 days after the first immunization . CONCLUSIONS	The data suggest that a single dose of the IM bivalent norovirus vaccine is effective in activating pre-existing B cell memory . CONCLUSIONS	The rapid B cell response and the mucosal homing phenotype of induced ASCs are consistent with anamnestic responses in subjects primed by prior oral norovirus infection . CONCLUSIONS	This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01609257 ."
"BACKGROUND	Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) and functional abdominal pain ( syndrome ) ( FAP ( S ) ) are common pediatric disorders , characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain . BACKGROUND	Treatment is challenging , especially in children with persisting symptoms . BACKGROUND	Gut-directed hypnotherapy ( HT ) performed by a therapist has been shown to be effective in these children , but is still unavailable to many children due to costs , a lack of qualified child-hypnotherapists and because it requires a significant investment of time by child and parent ( s ) . BACKGROUND	Home-based hypnotherapy by means of exercises on CD has been shown effective as well , and has potential benefits , such as lower costs and less time investment . BACKGROUND	The aim of this randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) is to compare cost-effectiveness of individual HT performed by a qualified therapist with HT by means of CD recorded self-exercises at home in children with IBS or FAP ( S ) . METHODS	260 children , aged 8-18 years with IBS or FAP ( S ) according to Rome III criteria are included in this currently conducted RCT with a follow-up period of one year . METHODS	Children are randomized to either 6 sessions of individual HT given by a qualified therapist over a 3-month period or HT through self-exercises at home with CD for 3 months.The primary outcome is the proportion of patients in which treatment is successful at the end of treatment and after one year follow-up . METHODS	Treatment success is defined as at least 50 % reduction in both abdominal pain frequency and intensity scores . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include adequate relief , cost-effectiveness and effects of both therapies on depression and anxiety scores , somatization scores , QoL , pain beliefs and coping strategies . CONCLUSIONS	If the effectiveness of home-based HT with CD is comparable to , or only slightly lower , than HT by a therapist , this treatment may become an attractive form of therapy in children with IBS or FAP ( S ) , because of its low costs and direct availability .

"BACKGROUND	The potential health benefits of curcumin are limited by its poor solubility , low absorption from the gut , rapid metabolism and rapid systemic elimination . BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was the comparative measurement of the increases in levels of curcuminoids ( curcumin , demethoxycurcumin , bisdemethoxycurcumin ) and the metabolite tetrahydrocurcumin after oral administration of three different curcumin formulations in comparison to unformulated standard . METHODS	The relative absorption of a curcumin phytosome formulation ( CP ) , a formulation with volatile oils of turmeric rhizome ( CTR ) and a formulation of curcumin with a combination of hydrophilic carrier , cellulosic derivatives and natural antioxidants ( CHC ) in comparison to a standardized curcumin mixture ( CS ) was investigated in a randomized , double-blind , crossover human study in healthy volunteers . METHODS	Samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS . RESULTS	Total curcuminoids appearance in the blood was 1.3-fold higher for CTR and 7.9-fold higher for CP in comparison to unformulated CS . RESULTS	CHC showed a 45.9-fold higher absorption over CS and significantly improved absorption over CP ( 5.8-fold ) and CTR ( 34.9-fold , all p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	A formulation of curcumin with a combination of hydrophilic carrier , cellulosic derivatives and natural antioxidants significantly increases curcuminoid appearance in the blood in comparison to unformulated standard curcumin CS , CTR and CP ."
"OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to test whether a very early nutrition intervention delivered over the telephone was feasible and could improve outcomes amongst patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer . METHODS	Participants with a histologically proven new diagnosis of primary oesophageal or stomach cancer and who were to undergo surgery and/or chemotherapy were randomised to receive either standard nutrition care ( SC ) or early and intensive nutrition intervention ( NI ) over the telephone/face-to-face . METHODS	Participants were followed for 6 months . METHODS	The primary outcome was quality of life ( QoL ) , assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Global Quality of Life questionnaire C30 ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) and the European Quality of Life Instrument ( EQ-5D ) tool ; secondary outcomes were nutritional status and survival . RESULTS	Twenty-one participants were recruited ( 11 SC and 10 NI ) . RESULTS	At baseline , the prevalence of malnutrition was 90 % . RESULTS	Compared with SC , the NI group had a significantly higher EORTC global QoL score at the first mid-study follow-up ( coefficient ( 95 % CI ) 21.0 ( 12.1 , 29.9 ) adjusted for baseline , p < 0.001 ) and at 26 weeks ( 28.4 ( 21.3 , 35.4 ) adjusted for baseline , p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Nutritional risk score was lower ( p < 0.001 ) , and loss of body weight attenuated ( p < 0.001 ) in the NI group compared with SC . RESULTS	Six deaths occurred during the study , five in the SC group and one in the NI group ( p = 0.06 ) . RESULTS	The mean time spent with a dietitian per contact was significantly less for the NI group compared with SC ( 16 ( 3 ) vs 40 ( 6 ) min per dietetic contact , p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study has shown the potential of a novel telephone-based early and intensive dietetic model of care for newly diagnosed upper gastrointestinal cancer patients ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of a psycho-educational intervention designed to improve effective coping and reduce symptom severity in children with cancer . BACKGROUND	Cancer treatments increase survival rates and also cause physical and psychological effects on children with cancer . BACKGROUND	A psycho-educational intervention is used to assist children and adolescents with these effects and its efficacy has been described in several studies . METHODS	A randomized controlled trial . METHODS	Participants being treated were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups from September 2011-February 2013 in Taiwan . METHODS	The intervention group received a psycho-educational intervention in addition to standard care , while the control group received only standard care . METHODS	Each participant was assessed using a paediatric cancer coping scale and perceived symptom severity was evaluated at three time points ( baseline , 1 month and 3 months ) . METHODS	A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to estimate the effects of intervention . METHODS	Qualitative findings were analysed using content analysis . RESULTS	No significant difference in coping scores was found between groups , but the experimental group reported significantly lower scores in gastrointestinal problems and pain . RESULTS	Most symptoms decreased significantly over time in both groups , except for gastrointestinal problems . RESULTS	The scores in pain , bone marrow suppression and body image showed significant interaction effects between groups on changes over time . RESULTS	Qualitative results reported that participants evaluated the intervention positively , especially about receipt of psychological support and learnt coping skills . CONCLUSIONS	The psycho-educational intervention administered was acceptable for children with cancer and was found to reduce gastrointestinal problems and pain ."
"OBJECTIVE	To develop and validate a scoring system for evaluation of long term anorectal dysfunction following radiotherapy for prostate cancer . METHODS	Patients treated for prostate cancer with radiotherapy filled in questionnaires on anorectal function and quality of life . METHODS	Items for the condensed anorectal dysfunction score ( RT-ARD ) were identified and weighted by binomial regression analysis . METHODS	The score was tested in a separate patient material by receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) analysis and correlations to quality of life domains . RESULTS	A total of 309 patients participated in the study . RESULTS	The items selected were `` incontinence for solid stool '' , `` ability to defer defecation '' , `` unproductive call to stool '' , `` clustering of stool '' , and `` mucus in stool . '' RESULTS	Patients were grouped into three categories according to the RT-ARD score ; 0-8 ( no RT-ARD ) , 9-23 ( minor RT-ARD ) , 24-45 ( major RT-ARD ) . RESULTS	ROC analyses revealed high sensitivity ( 91 % ) and specificity ( 85 % ) for major RT-ARD . RESULTS	The prediction model demonstrated a perfect fit in 60 % , moderate fit in 36 % and no fit in 4 % . RESULTS	There was good correlation between the RT-ARD score and quality of life . CONCLUSIONS	The RT-ARD score is a validated and simple instrument for evaluation of anorectal dysfunction following radiotherapy for prostate cancer , and the RT-ARD score correlates to the patient 's quality of life ."
"BACKGROUND	Pelubiprofen is a prodrug of 2-arylpropionic acid with relatively selective effects on cyclooxygenase-2 activity . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of pelubiprofen with those of celecoxib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . METHODS	This was a 6-week , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group , phase III , non-inferiority clinical trial . METHODS	The primary end point was non-inferiority of pain decrease from baseline to week-6 as determined using a 100 mm pain visual analog scale ( VAS ) . METHODS	Pelubiprofen was considered non-inferior to celecoxib if the lower limit of the 97.5 % confidence interval for treatment difference [ ( pain reduction in pelubiprofen group ) - ( pain reduction in celecoxib group ) ] was more than -10 mm . METHODS	The secondary end points were as follows : non-inferiority of ( 1 ) reduction of Korean health assessment questionnaire ( KHAQ ) score ; ( 2 ) decreased duration of morning stiffness ; and ( 3 ) decrease in the frequency and total dose of rescue drugs after 6 weeks of treatment . RESULTS	Seventy-seven patients in the pelubiprofen group and 68 patients in the celecoxib group started the study medication . RESULTS	Pelubiprofen was non-inferior to celecoxib with regard to reduction in VAS pain severity ( difference , mean SD 5.0 20.1 ; 97.5 % CI , -2.3 to ) . RESULTS	Pelubiprofen was also non-inferior to celecoxib in terms of the secondary end points , such as , decrease in KHAQ score ( 0.0 0.5 , 97.5 % CI -0.2 to ) , decrease in duration of morning stiffness ( median 0.0 minute in both groups ) , and decrease in the frequency ( 0.7 3.5 , 97.5 % CI -0.6 to ) and total amount ( 0.7 3.6 , 97.5 % CI -0.6 to ) of rescue medication uses during the 6 week study period . RESULTS	Safety analysis revealed 31.2 % patients in the pelubiprofen group and 20.6 % patients in the celecoxib group experienced an adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) . RESULTS	The frequency of gastrointestinal ADRs was 20.8 % and 8.8 % , respectively . CONCLUSIONS	Pelubiprofen was found to be as effective as celecoxib at pain reduction and for relieving stiffness in RA patients . CONCLUSIONS	However , more patients in the pelubiprofen group experienced ADR and the frequency of gastrointestinal ADRs was higher in the pelubiprofen group .

"BACKGROUND	CLP is an orally administered , non-absorbed , superabsorbent polymer being developed to increase fecal excretion of sodium , potassium and water in patients with heart failure and end-stage renal disease . BACKGROUND	This study was conducted to evaluate the safety of CLP , and to explore dose-related effects on fecal weight , fecal and urine sodium and potassium excretion , and serum electrolyte concentrations . METHODS	This Phase 1 , open-label , dose-escalation study included 25 healthy volunteers , who were administered CLP orally immediately prior to four daily meals for 9 days at doses of 7.5 , 15.0 , and 25.0 g/day ( n = 5/group ) . METHODS	An additional dose group received 15.0 g/day CLP under fasting conditions , and an untreated cohort ( n = 5 ) served as control . METHODS	Twenty-four-hour fecal and urinary output was collected daily . METHODS	Samples were weighed , and sodium , potassium , and other ion content in stool and urine were measured for each treatment group . METHODS	Effects on serum cation concentrations , other standard laboratory values , and adverse events were also determined . RESULTS	At doses below 25.0 g/day , CLP was well tolerated , with a low frequency of self-limiting gastrointestinal adverse events . RESULTS	CLP increased fecal weight and fecal sodium and potassium content in a dose-related manner . RESULTS	Concomitant dose-related decreases in urinary sodium and potassium were observed . RESULTS	All serum ion concentrations remained within normal limits . CONCLUSIONS	In this study , oral CLP removed water , sodium and potassium from the body via the gastrointestinal tract in a dose related fashion . CONCLUSIONS	CLP could become useful for patients with fluid overload and compromised kidney function in conditions such as congestive heart failure , salt sensitive hypertension , chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease .

"OBJECTIVE	Odors are powerful emotional stimuli influencing mood , attention and behavior . OBJECTIVE	Here we examined if odors change the perception of pleasant touch . OBJECTIVE	In line with the warning function of the olfactory system , we proposed that especially unpleasant odors will reduce touch pleasantness , presumably through a disgust-related mechanism . METHODS	Forty-five healthy participants ( mean age 23.3 + / - 3years SD , 24 females ) were presented to slow ( 3 cm/s ) and fast ( 30 cm/s ) brush stroking delivered by a robot to the forearm . METHODS	Touch pleasantness under the influence of an unpleasant odor ( Civette , smelling like feces ) and an intensity matched pleasant odor ( Rose ) was compared to an odorless control condition . METHODS	In a pilot study with 30 participants ( mean age 25.9 + / -6 years , 21 females ) , the odors were matched according to their intensity , and we studied the influence of disgust sensitivity on the perception of 4 different odor qualities . RESULTS	The unpleasant odor decreased touch pleasantness for both stroking velocities compared to the odorless control ( p < 0.005 ) whereas the rose odor did not change touch pleasantness significantly . RESULTS	Disgust sensitivity was correlated with the modulation of touch pleasantness . RESULTS	The pilot study revealed a significant correlation between disgust sensitivity and the perception of the unpleasant odor qualities ( r = -0.56 ; p = 0.007 ) , but not with any of the other odors . CONCLUSIONS	Unpleasant odors are powerful in modulating touch pleasantness , and disgust might be a moderating variable ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate the combination of endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) and computed tomography ( CT ) in predicting the maneuvers for therapeutic endoscopy for gastrointestinal submucosal tumors ( SMTs ) . METHODS	Patients with SMTs , who were scheduled for endoscopic resection , were randomized to preoperative performance of both EUS and CT ( group A ) or EUS only ( group B ) . METHODS	The following data were collected : therapeutic maneuvers , duration of procedure , dose of propofol , resected lesion size , and complications . RESULTS	A total of 36 patients were included in group A and 36 patients were included in group B. Endoscopic submucosal excavation was performed in 43 patients , endoscopic full-thickness resection in 18 patients , and submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection in 11 patients . RESULTS	No significant differences were observed between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The coincidence rate between the preoperative program and the actual endoscopic procedures in group A was higher than that in group B ( 83.3 vs. 61.1 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The procedural time in group A was less than that in group B ( 39.3617.83 vs. 48.0612.03 min , P < 0.05 ) , and the dose of propofol in group A was less than that in group B ( 249.18125.12 vs. 304.16102.61 mg , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The mean resected lesion size was 2.321.46 cm in group A and 2.120.75 cm in group B , without differences ( P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	A total of 14 cardiopulmonary complications and seven endoscopic complications occurred , without significant differences between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	EUS combined with CT can better evaluate SMTs compared with EUS only in predicting the maneuvers for therapeutic endoscopy ."
"BACKGROUND	Most patients with Crohn 's disease need an intestinal resection , but a majority will subsequently experience disease recurrence and require further surgery . BACKGROUND	This study aimed to identify the optimal strategy to prevent postoperative disease recurrence . METHODS	In this randomised trial , consecutive patients from 17 centres in Australia and New Zealand undergoing intestinal resection of all macroscopic Crohn 's disease , with an endoscopically accessible anastomosis , received 3 months of metronidazole therapy . METHODS	Patients at high risk of recurrence also received a thiopurine , or adalimumab if they were intolerant to thiopurines . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to parallel groups : colonoscopy at 6 months ( active care ) or no colonoscopy ( standard care ) . METHODS	We used computer-generated block randomisation to allocate patients in each centre to active or standard care in a 2:1 ratio . METHODS	For endoscopic recurrence ( Rutgeerts score i2 ) at 6 months , patients stepped-up to thiopurine , fortnightly adalimumab with thiopurine , or weekly adalimumab . METHODS	The primary endpoint was endoscopic recurrence at 18 months . METHODS	Patients and treating physicians were aware of the patient 's study group and treatment , but central reading of the endoscopic findings was undertaken blind to the study group and treatment . METHODS	Analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug . METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00989560 . RESULTS	Between Oct 13 , 2009 , and Sept 28 , 2011 , 174 ( 83 % high risk across both active and standard care groups ) patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study drug . RESULTS	Of 122 patients in the active care group , 47 ( 39 % ) stepped-up treatment . RESULTS	At 18 months , endoscopic recurrence occurred in 60 ( 49 % ) patients in the active care group and 35 ( 67 % ) patients in the standard care group ( p = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	Complete mucosal normality was maintained in 27 ( 22 % ) of 122 patients in the active care group versus four ( 8 % ) in the standard care group ( p = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	In the active care arm , of those with 6 months recurrence who stepped up treatment , 18 ( 38 % ) of 47 patients were in remission 12 months later ; conversely , of those in remission at 6 months who did not change therapy recurrence occurred in 31 ( 41 % ) of 75 patients 12 months later . RESULTS	Smoking ( odds ratio [ OR ] 2.4 , 95 % CI 1.2-4 .8 , p = 0.02 ) and the presence of two or more clinical risk factors including smoking ( OR 2.8 , 95 % CI 1.01-7 .7 , p = 0.05 ) increased the risk of endoscopic recurrence . RESULTS	The incidence and type of adverse and severe adverse events did not differ significantly between patients in the active care and standard care groups ( 100 [ 82 % ] of 122 vs 45 [ 87 % ] of 52 ; p = 0.51 ) and ( 33 [ 27 % ] of 122 vs 18 [ 35 % ] of 52 ; p = 0.36 ) , respectively . CONCLUSIONS	Treatment according to clinical risk of recurrence , with early colonoscopy and treatment step-up for recurrence , is better than conventional drug therapy alone for prevention of postoperative Crohn 's disease recurrence . CONCLUSIONS	Selective immune suppression , adjusted for early recurrence , rather than routine use , leads to disease control in most patients . CONCLUSIONS	Clinical risk factors predict recurrence , but patients at low risk also need monitoring . CONCLUSIONS	Early remission does not preclude the need for ongoing monitoring .

"OBJECTIVE	Recent preclinical work has suggested that postprandial flow of bile acids into the small intestine potentiates nutrient-induced glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP1 ( GCG ) ) secretion via bile acid-induced activation of the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 in intestinal L cells . OBJECTIVE	The notion of bile-induced GLP1 secretion combined with the findings of reduced postprandial gallbladder emptying in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) led us to speculate whether reduced postprandial GLP1 responses in some patients with T2DM arise as a consequence of diabetic gallbladder dysmotility . METHODS	In a randomised design , 15 patients with long-standing T2DM and 15 healthy age - , gender - and BMI-matched control subjects were studied during 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) and three isocaloric ( 500kcal ) and isovolaemic ( 350ml ) liquid meals : i ) 2.5 g fat , 107g carbohydrate and 13g protein ; ii ) 10g fat , 93g carbohydrate and 11g protein ; and iii ) 40g fat , 32g carbohydrate and 3g protein . METHODS	Basal and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose , insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , GLP1 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , cholecystokinin and gastrin were measured . METHODS	Furthermore , gallbladder emptying and gastric emptying were examined . RESULTS	Gallbladder emptying increased with increasing meal fat content , but no intergroup differences were demonstrated . RESULTS	GIP and GLP1 responses were comparable among the groups with GIP levels being higher following high-fat meals , whereas GLP1 secretion was similar after both OGTT and meals . CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion , patients with T2DM exhibited normal gallbladder emptying to meals with a wide range of fat content . CONCLUSIONS	Incretin responses were similar to that in controls , and an association with postprandial gallbladder contraction could not be demonstrated ."
"OBJECTIVE	To compare the difference in the clinical efficacy on premature ovarian failure ( POF ) between the acupoint catgut implantation combined with artifical periodic therapy and the simple artificial periodic therapy and explore its effect mechanism . METHODS	Sixty-five patients of POF were randomized into the two groups . METHODS	In a western medication group , 32 cases were treated with the artificial periodic therapy with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets . METHODS	In a catgut implantation + western medication group , 33 cases were treated with the acupoint catgut implantation combined with artificial periodic therapy . METHODS	The acupoints of Neiguan ( PC 6 ) , Zusanli ( ST 36 ) , Guanyuan ( CV 4 ) and Sanyinjiao ( SP 6 ) were selected . METHODS	The treatment was lasted for half a year and the follow-up visit was for another half a year in the two groups . METHODS	Kupperman index was used to assess the improvements in the clinical symptoms . METHODS	The levels of serum sexual hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and estradiol ( E2 ) were evaluated of the patients in the two groups before and after treatment . METHODS	The efficacy was compared between the two groups . RESULTS	The scores of the clinical symptoms were all significantly improved after treatment and in the follow-up in the two groups ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	In the 6-month follow-up visit after treatment , the result in the catgut implantation + western medication group was better than that in the western medication group ( 8.17 + / - 1.19 vs 13.68 + / - 1.08 , P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	FSH was reduced after treatment in the two groups ( all P < 0.01 ) and E2 was increased ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The curative and remarkably effective rates were 75.8 % ( 25/33 ) and 81.8 % ( 27/22 ) after treatment and in the follow-up visit in the catgut implantation + western medication group , which were better than 67.9 % ( 19/28 ) and 53.6 % ( 15/28 ) in the western medication group separately ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The acupoint catgut implantation combined with artificial periodic therapy achieve the remarkable improvements in the clinical symptoms of POF in the patients and the better results as compared with the simple western medication therapy . CONCLUSIONS	The combined therapys efficacy is stable and the long-term efficacy is apparently superior . CONCLUSIONS	The effect mechanism is related to the improvements in the serum sexual hormone levels ."
"OBJECTIVE	Despite treatment with glucocorticoids , mortality remains high in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis . OBJECTIVE	Oxidative stress and depletion of mitochondrial glutathione are implicated factors in liver injury . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the addition of metadoxine , a drug which possesses a multifactorial mechanism of action , including antioxidant properties , to standard treatment with glucocorticoids in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis . METHODS	This randomized open label clinical trial was performed in Mexico 's General Hospital ( Registry Key DIC/10/107 / 03/043 ) . METHODS	We randomized 70 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis . METHODS	The first group received prednisone ( 40 mg/day ) , and the second group received prednisone ( 40 mg/day ) plus metadoxine tablets ( 500 mg three times daily ) . METHODS	The duration of treatment in both groups was 30 days . METHODS	Survival at 30 and 90 days , development of complications , adverse events and response to treatment ( Lille model ) were assessed . RESULTS	In the group receiving metadoxine , significant improvements were observed , as follows : survival at 30 days ( 74.3 vs. 45.7 % , P = 0.02 ) ; survival at 90 days ( 68.6 vs. 20.0 % , P = 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	There was less development or progression of encephalopathy ( 28.6 vs. 60.0 % , P = 0.008 ) and hepatorenal syndrome ( 31.4 vs. 54.3 % , P = 0.05 ) , and the response to treatment ( Lille model ) was higher in the metadoxine group ( 0.38 vs. 0.63 , P = 0.001 ; 95 % CI 0.11 to 0.40 ) . RESULTS	There were no differences between groups regarding the development or progression of variceal hemorrhage or infection . RESULTS	The incidence of adverse events , mainly gastrointestinal , was similar in both groups . CONCLUSIONS	Addition of metadoxine to glucocorticoid treatment improves the short-term survival of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis and diminishes the development or progression of encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome ."
"BACKGROUND	Iron supplementation for hypoferremic anemia could potentiate bacterial growth in the cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung , but clinical trials testing this hypothesis are lacking . METHODS	Twenty-two adults with CF and hypoferremic anemia participated in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial of ferrous sulfate 325mg daily for 6weeks . METHODS	Iron-related hematologic parameters , anthropometric data , sputum iron , Akron Pulmonary Exacerbation Score ( PES ) , and the sputum microbiome were serially assessed . METHODS	Fixed-effect models were used to describe how ferrous sulfate affected these variables . RESULTS	Ferrous sulfate increased serum iron by 22.3 % and transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) by 26.8 % from baseline ( p < 0.05 ) but did not affect hemoglobin , sputum iron , Akron PES , and the sputum microbiome . CONCLUSIONS	Low-dose ferrous sulfate improved hypoferremia without correcting anemia after 6weeks . CONCLUSIONS	We did not observe significant effects on sputum iron , Akron PES , and the sputum microbiome . CONCLUSIONS	Although we did not identify untoward health effects of iron supplementation , a larger blinded randomized controlled trial would be needed to fully demonstrate safety ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of postoperative early oral feeding on humoral immune function and clinical outcome in colorectal cancer patients . METHODS	Seventy patients with colorectal carcinoma requiring elective colorectal resection were prospectively enrolled and randomized into two groups : early oral feeding group ( n = 35 ) and conventional oral feeding group ( n = 35 ) . METHODS	The patients in early oral feeding group were started on oral feeding within 12 hours after operation , while patients in conventional group were started on oral feeding after the postoperative first passage of flatus . METHODS	Postoperative parameters of clinic and humeral immune function were compared between two groups . RESULTS	Sixty-two patients eventually completed the study , including 32 cases in early oral feeding group and 30 cases in conventional oral feeding group . RESULTS	The average time to first passage of flatus [ ( 21 ) d vs. ( 42 ) d , P < 0.01 ] , the first passage of stool [ ( 3.81.6 ) d vs. ( 6.42.5 ) d , P < 0.01 ] , resumption of regular diet [ ( 42 ) d vs. ( 8.22.2 ) d , P < 0.01 ] and the postoperative hospital stay [ ( 61 ) d vs. ( 11.73.8 ) d , P < 0.01 ] were significantly shorter in early oral feeding group as compared to conventional oral feeding group . RESULTS	Significantly faster recovery of postoperative humoral immunity was found . RESULTS	Plasma levels of globulin [ ( 24.12.4 ) g/L vs. ( 22.13.3 ) g/L , P < 0.05 ] , immunoglobulin G [ ( 10.82.4 ) g/L vs. ( 8.72.1 ) g/L , P < 0.01 ] and complement 4 [ ( 0.240.09 ) g/L vs. ( 0.170.05 ) g/L , P < 0.05 ] on postoperative day 3 were higher in early oral feeding group as compared to conventional oral feeding group . CONCLUSIONS	Application of postoperative early oral feeding in patients undergoing elective colorectal resection is safe and effective , which can lead to faster recovery of postoperative humoral immune function and bowel function , and shorter postoperative hospital stay ."
"OBJECTIVE	Paralytic ileus after laparoscopic-assisted surgery often occurs . OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether daikenchuto ( DKT ) , a traditional Japanese herbal medicine , improves intestinal motility in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for colon cancer . METHODS	Fifty-four patients who underwent colectomy at Iwate Medical University Hospital between October 2010 and March 2012 were randomized to either the DKT group ( 7.5 g/day , p.o. ) or the control group ( lactobacillus preparation , 3g/day , p.o. ) . METHODS	Primary endpoints included time to first flatus , bowel movement , and tolerance of diet after extubation . METHODS	Secondary endpoints were WBC count , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level , length of hospital stay , and postoperative ileus . METHODS	Colonic transit time was measured using radiopaque markers and abdominal radiographs . RESULTS	Fifty-one patients ( DKT , 26 vs. control , 25 ) were included in the per-protocol analysis . RESULTS	The DKT group had significantly faster time until first flatus ( 67.5 + / - 13.6 h vs. 77.9 + / - 11.8 h , P < 0.01 ) and bowel movement ( 82.9 + / - 17.8 h vs. 99.5 + / - 18.9 h , P < 0.01 ) and colonic transit time ( 91.9 + / - 19.8 h vs. 115.2 + / - 12.8 h , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There were no significant intergroup differences in secondary endpoints and adverse events .

"OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of two doses of once-weekly dulaglutide , a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist , to sitagliptin in uncontrolled , metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes . OBJECTIVE	The primary objective was to compare ( for noninferiority and then superiority ) dulaglutide 1.5 mg versus sitagliptin in change from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) at 52 weeks . METHODS	This multicenter , adaptive , double-blind , parallel-arm study randomized patients ( N = 1,098 ; mean baseline age 54 years ; HbA1c 8.1 % [ 65 mmol/mol ] ; weight 86.4 kg ; diabetes duration 7 years ) to dulaglutide 1.5 mg , dulaglutide 0.75 mg , sitagliptin 100 mg , or placebo ( placebo-controlled period up to 26 weeks ) . METHODS	The treatment period lasted 104 weeks , with 52-week primary end point data presented . RESULTS	The mean HbA1c changes to 52 weeks were ( least squares mean SE ) : -1.10 0.06 % ( -12.0 0.7 mmol/mol ) , -0.87 0.06 % ( 9.5 0.7 mmol/mol ) , and -0.39 0.06 % ( 4.3 0.7 mmol/mol ) for dulaglutide 1.5 mg , dulaglutide 0.75 mg , and sitagliptin , respectively . RESULTS	Both dulaglutide doses were superior to sitagliptin ( P < 0.001 , both comparisons ) . RESULTS	No events of severe hypoglycemia were reported . RESULTS	Mean weight changes to 52 weeks were greater with dulaglutide 1.5 mg ( -3.03 0.22 kg ) and dulaglutide 0.75 mg ( -2.60 0.23 kg ) compared with sitagliptin ( -1.53 0.22 kg ) ( P < 0.001 , both comparisons ) . RESULTS	The most common gastrointestinal treatment-emergent adverse events in dulaglutide 1.5 - and 0.75-mg arms were nausea , diarrhea , and vomiting . CONCLUSIONS	Both dulaglutide doses demonstrated superior glycemic control versus sitagliptin at 52 weeks with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile ."
"BACKGROUND	Patients with isolated locoregional recurrences ( ILRR ) of breast cancer have a high risk of distant metastasis and death from breast cancer . BACKGROUND	We aimed to establish whether adjuvant chemotherapy improves the outcome of such patients . METHODS	The CALOR trial was a pragmatic , open-label , randomised trial that accrued patients with histologically proven and completely excised ILRR after unilateral breast cancer who had undergone a mastectomy or lumpectomy with clear surgical margins . METHODS	Eligible patients were enrolled from hospitals worldwide and were centrally randomised ( 1:1 ) to chemotherapy ( type selected by the investigator ; multidrug for at least four courses recommended ) or no chemotherapy , using permuted blocks , and stratified by previous chemotherapy , oestrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor status , and location of ILRR . METHODS	Patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive ILRR received adjuvant endocrine therapy , radiation therapy was mandated for patients with microscopically involved surgical margins , and anti-HER2 therapy was optional . METHODS	The primary endpoint was disease-free survival . METHODS	All analyses were by intention to treat . METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00074152 . RESULTS	From Aug 22 , 2003 , to Jan 31 , 2010 , 85 patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy and 77 were assigned to no chemotherapy . RESULTS	At a median follow-up of 49 years ( IQR 36-6 0 ) , 24 ( 28 % ) patients had disease-free survival events in the chemotherapy group compared with 34 ( 44 % ) in the no chemotherapy group . RESULTS	5-year disease-free survival was 69 % ( 95 % CI 56-79 ) with chemotherapy versus 57 % ( 44-67 ) without chemotherapy ( hazard ratio 059 [ 95 % CI 035-099 ] ; p = 0046 ) . RESULTS	Adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly more effective for women with oestrogen-receptor-negative ILRR ( pinteraction = 0046 ) , but analyses of disease-free survival according to the oestrogen-receptor status of the primary tumour were not statistically significant ( pinteraction = 043 ) . RESULTS	Of the 81 patients who received chemotherapy , 12 ( 15 % ) had serious adverse events . RESULTS	The most common adverse events were neutropenia , febrile neutropenia , and intestinal infection . CONCLUSIONS	Adjuvant chemotherapy should be recommended for patients with completely resected ILRR of breast cancer , especially if the recurrence is oestrogen-receptor negative .

"BACKGROUND	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) promotes angiogenesis , a mediator of disease progression in cervical cancer . BACKGROUND	Bevacizumab , a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody , has single-agent activity in previously treated , recurrent disease . BACKGROUND	Most patients in whom recurrent cervical cancer develops have previously received cisplatin with radiation therapy , which reduces the effectiveness of cisplatin at the time of recurrence . BACKGROUND	We evaluated the effectiveness of bevacizumab and nonplatinum combination chemotherapy in patients with recurrent , persistent , or metastatic cervical cancer . METHODS	Using a 2-by-2 factorial design , we randomly assigned 452 patients to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight . METHODS	Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg per square meter of body-surface area , plus paclitaxel at a dose of 135 or 175 mg per square meter or topotecan at a dose of 0.75 mg per square meter on days 1 to 3 , plus paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg per square meter on day 1 . METHODS	Cycles were repeated every 21 days until disease progression , the development of unacceptable toxic effects , or a complete response was documented . METHODS	The primary end point was overall survival ; a reduction of 30 % in the hazard ratio for death was considered clinically important . RESULTS	Groups were well balanced with respect to age , histologic findings , performance status , previous use or nonuse of a radiosensitizing platinum agent , and disease status . RESULTS	Topotecan-paclitaxel was not superior to cisplatin-paclitaxel ( hazard ratio for death , 1.20 ) . RESULTS	With the data for the two chemotherapy regimens combined , the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy was associated with increased overall survival ( 17.0 months vs. 13.3 months ; hazard ratio for death , 0.71 ; 98 % confidence interval , 0.54 to 0.95 ; P = 0.004 in a one-sided test ) and higher response rates ( 48 % vs. 36 % , P = 0.008 ) . RESULTS	Bevacizumab , as compared with chemotherapy alone , was associated with an increased incidence of hypertension of grade 2 or higher ( 25 % vs. 2 % ) , thromboembolic events of grade 3 or higher ( 8 % vs. 1 % ) , and gastrointestinal fistulas of grade 3 or higher ( 3 % vs. 0 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	The addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy in patients with recurrent , persistent , or metastatic cervical cancer was associated with an improvement of 3.7 months in median overall survival .

"BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to identify optimal target propofol and remifentanil concentrations to avoid a gag reflex in response to insertion of an upper gastrointestinal endoscope . METHODS	Patients presenting for endoscopy received target-controlled infusions ( TCI ) of both propofol and remifentanil for sedation-analgesia . METHODS	Patients were randomized to 4 groups of fixed target effect-site concentrations : remifentanil 1 ngmL ( REMI 1 ) or 2 ngmL ( REMI 2 ) and propofol 2 gmL ( PROP 2 ) or 3 gmL ( PROP 3 ) . METHODS	For each group , the other drug ( propofol for the REMI groups and vice versa ) was increased or decreased using the `` up-down '' method based on the presence or absence of a gag response in the previous patient . METHODS	A modified isotonic regression method was used to estimate the median effective Ce ,50 from the up-down method in each group . METHODS	A concentration-effect ( sigmoid Emax ) model was built to estimate the corresponding Ce ,90 for each group . METHODS	These data were used to estimate propofol bolus doses and remifentanil infusion rates that would achieve effect-site concentrations between Ce ,50 and Ce ,90 when a TCI system is not available for use . RESULTS	One hundred twenty-four patients were analyzed . RESULTS	To achieve between a 50 % and 90 % probability of no gag response , propofol TCIs were between 2.40 and 4.23 gmL ( that could be achieved with a bolus of 1 mgkg ) when remifentanil TCI was fixed at 1 ngmL , and target propofol TCIs were between 2.15 and 2.88 gmL ( that could be achieved with a bolus of 0.75 mgkg ) when remifentanil TCI was fixed at 2 ngmL . RESULTS	Remifentanil ranges were 1.00 to 4.79 ngmL and 0.72 to 3.19 ngmL when propofol was fixed at 2 and 3 gmL , respectively . CONCLUSIONS	We identified a set of propofol and remifentanil TCIs that blocked the gag response to endoscope insertion in patients undergoing endoscopy . CONCLUSIONS	Propofol bolus doses and remifentanil infusion rates designed to achieve similar effect-site concentrations can be used to prevent gag response when TCI is not available ."
"BACKGROUND	Introducing colonoscopy as part of colorectal cancer screening on a national level , we aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the two most common bowel cleansing agents , Moviprep ( ) and Phosphoral ( ) . BACKGROUND	Secondly , we evaluated the benefit for the patient and society in terms of sick leave and discomfort . METHODS	In a single-blinded randomized equivalence trial , Phosphoral ( ) ( NaP ) was compared with Moviprep ( ) ( 2 l polyethylene glycol + ascorbic acid ) in patients undergoing colonoscopy due to suspicion of cancer . METHODS	Patients filled out questionnaires concerning stool consistency , discomfort and number of sick days due to bowel cleansing . METHODS	Blinded colonoscopists estimated the efficiency of the cleansing using the validated Harefield Cleansing Scale . RESULTS	Two hundred and sixty-six patients were included 250 of whom underwent full colonoscopy . RESULTS	There was no difference in the percentage of acceptable bowel cleansings in the two groups ; however , a significantly higher number of A scores were observed in the Moviprep ( ) group ( p = 0.028 ) . RESULTS	We found no correlation between stool consistency and outcome of the cleansing and no difference in subjective discomfort during cleansing . RESULTS	Vomiting during cleansing occurred more often in the Phosphoral ( ) group ( p = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	There was a trend toward a smaller number of sick days in patients who used Moviprep ( ) compared with Phosphoral ( ) . CONCLUSIONS	Moviprep ( ) and Phosphoral ( ) provided equally efficient bowel cleansing in 90 % of patients , but Moviprep ( ) provided a higher quality of cleansings graded as successful . CONCLUSIONS	The two agents were equally tolerated , and no difference was found in the related number of sick days ."
"BACKGROUND	Gastrointestinal bleeding ( GIB ) is a common and often serious complication after stroke . BACKGROUND	Although several risk factors for post-stroke GIB have been identified , no reliable or validated scoring system is currently available to predict GIB after acute stroke in routine clinical practice or clinical trials . BACKGROUND	In the present study , we aimed to develop and validate a risk model ( acute ischemic stroke associated gastrointestinal bleeding score , the AIS-GIB score ) to predict in-hospital GIB after acute ischemic stroke . METHODS	The AIS-GIB score was developed from data in the China National Stroke Registry ( CNSR ) . METHODS	Eligible patients in the CNSR were randomly divided into derivation ( 60 % ) and internal validation ( 40 % ) cohorts . METHODS	External validation was performed using data from the prospective Chinese Intracranial Atherosclerosis Study ( CICAS ) . METHODS	Independent predictors of in-hospital GIB were obtained using multivariable logistic regression in the derivation cohort , and - coefficients were used to generate point scoring system for the AIS-GIB . METHODS	The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC ) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to assess model discrimination and calibration , respectively . RESULTS	A total of 8,820 , 5,882 , and 2,938 patients were enrolled in the derivation , internal validation and external validation cohorts . RESULTS	The overall in-hospital GIB after AIS was 2.6 % , 2.3 % , and 1.5 % in the derivation , internal , and external validation cohort , respectively . RESULTS	An 18-point AIS-GIB score was developed from the set of independent predictors of GIB including age , gender , history of hypertension , hepatic cirrhosis , peptic ulcer or previous GIB , pre-stroke dependence , admission National Institutes of Health stroke scale score , Glasgow Coma Scale score and stroke subtype ( Oxfordshire ) . RESULTS	The AIS-GIB score showed good discrimination in the derivation ( 0.79 ; 95 % CI , 0.764-0 .825 ) , internal ( 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.74-0 .82 ) and external ( 0.76 ; 95 % CI , 0.71-0 .82 ) validation cohorts . RESULTS	The AIS-GIB score was well calibrated in the derivation ( P = 0.42 ) , internal ( P = 0.45 ) and external ( P = 0.86 ) validation cohorts . CONCLUSIONS	The AIS-GIB score is a valid clinical grading scale to predict in-hospital GIB after AIS . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies on the effect of the AIS-GIB score on reducing GIB and improving outcome after AIS are warranted ."
"BACKGROUND	Intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus is a very common side-effect that is difficult to prevent or treat . BACKGROUND	Central and peripheral mechanisms are believed to be involved . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to determine if a peripherally acting , - opioid antagonist would reduce morphine-induced pruritus . METHODS	We conducted a multicentre , randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled trial of women having elective Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal morphine 100 g. METHODS	After delivery , participants received either subcutaneous methylnatrexone bromide 12 mg ( MNTX group , n = 69 ) or saline ( placebo group , n = 68 ) . METHODS	Pruritus , nausea , pain , analgesic use , and side-effects were assessed at 2 , 4 , 8 , and 24 h. METHODS	The primary outcome was the severity of pruritus ( 0-10 score ) . RESULTS	One hundred and thirty-seven women completed the study , with five major protocol violations . RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between the MNTX and placebo groups for the median ( IQR ) pruritus AUC scores [ 24 ( 9-47 ) vs 36 ( 11-68 ) , median difference 8.5 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0-20 , P = 0.09 ] or the worst pruritus score [ 3 ( 2-7 ) vs 5 ( 2-6 ) , median difference 1 , 95 % CI 0-2 , P = 0.24 ] . RESULTS	The incidence of pruritus was 84 % in the MNTX group and 88 % in the placebo group ( P = 0.48 ) . RESULTS	Analgesic and gastrointestinal outcomes did not significantly differ between the groups . CONCLUSIONS	A single dose of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone bromide 12 mg did not reduce the overall severity or incidence of pruritus . CONCLUSIONS	In this study , treatment with a peripherally acting - opioid antagonist was generally ineffective against intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus , but a small clinical effect can not be excluded .

"METHODS	Oral ibuprofen has demonstrated good effects on symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) but with many contraindications and potential side-effects . METHODS	In the past two years , oral paracetamol administration to several preterm infants with PDA has been reported . METHODS	Here , a randomized , non-blinded , parallel-controlled and non-inferiority trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of oral paracetamol to those of standard ibuprofen for PDA closure in premature infants . METHODS	One hundred and sixty infants ( gestational age 34 weeks ) with echocardiographically confirmed PDA were randomly assigned to receive either oral paracetamol ( n = 80 ) or ibuprofen ( n = 80 ) . METHODS	After the initial treatment course in both groups , the need for a second course was determined by echocardiographic evaluation . METHODS	The main outcome was rate of ductal closure , and secondary outcomes were adverse effects and complications . RESULTS	The ductus was closed in 65 ( 81.2 % ) infants of the paracetamol group compared with 63 ( 78.8 % ) of the ibuprofen group . RESULTS	The 95 % confidence interval of the difference between these groups was [ -0.080,0.128 ] , demonstrating that the effectiveness of paracetamol treatment was not inferior to that of ibuprofen . RESULTS	In fact , the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia or gastrointestinal bleeding in the paracetamol group was significantly lower than that of the ibuprofen group . RESULTS	No significant differences in other clinical side effects or complications were noted . CONCLUSIONS	This comparison of drug efficacy and safety profiles in premature infants with PDA revealed that oral paracetamol was comparable to ibuprofen in terms of the rate of ductal closure and even showed a decreased risk of hyperbilirubinemia or gastrointestinal bleeding . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , paracetamol may be accepted as a first-line drug treatment for PDA in preterm infants . BACKGROUND	ChiCTR.org ChiCTR-TRC-12002177 ."
"BACKGROUND	Dumping syndrome is characterized by distinct pathophysiological features such as postprandial increase in hematocrit ( HT ) and pulse rate ( PR ) and delayed hypoglycemia ( HG ) . BACKGROUND	Treatment is based on dietary measures and somatostatin analogs ( SA ) , but current SAs have incomplete efficacy , possibly through limited affinity for various somatostatin receptor subtypes . BACKGROUND	We evaluated the effect of pasireotide , a novel SA with high affinity for 4/5 human somatostatin receptors , on pathophysiological events and symptoms in dumping . METHODS	Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study of nine patients ( six women , 474years ) with postoperative dumping . METHODS	Baseline measurements included oral glucose tolerance testing ( OGTT ) , abdominal ultrasound , and dumping symptom severity score ( DSSS ) . METHODS	Patients were treated for 2weeks with placebo or pasireotide 300g s.c. t.i.d. with a 1-week wash-out in a randomized fashion . METHODS	On day 13 and 14 of each treatment OGTT , DSSS , and solid and liquid gastric emptying ( GE ) were obtained . RESULTS	Baseline OGTT was pathological in all patients based on PR ( n = 5 ) , HT ( n = 1 ) or HG ( n = 7 ) . RESULTS	Compared to placebo , pasireotide suppressed the increase in PR ( 17.12.8 vs 8.23.5 bpm ; p < 0.05 ) and late HG ( nadir glycemia 55.64.3 vs 83.39.5 mg/dL ; p = 0.007 ) , increased peak glycemia ( 294.133.3 vs 221.023.1 mg/dL ; p = 0.001 ) and delayed GE of solids ( t1/2 8323 vs 439min ; p = 0.05 ) and liquids ( t1/2 7010 vs 404min , p = 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The differences in DSSS did not reach statistical significance . RESULTS	Two patients dropped out because of adverse gastrointestinal events under pasireotide . CONCLUSIONS	Pasireotide affects pathophysiological features of both early and late dumping syndrome ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of nutrient stimulation of gut hormones by oligofructose supplementation on appetite , energy intake ( EI ) , body weight ( BW ) and adiposity in overweight and obese volunteers . METHODS	In a parallel , single-blind and placebo-controlled study , 22 healthy overweight and obese volunteers were randomly allocated to receive 30 g day ( -1 ) oligofructose or cellulose for 6 weeks following a 2-week run-in . METHODS	Subjective appetite and side effect scores , breath hydrogen , serum short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , plasma gut hormones , glucose and insulin concentrations , EI , BW and adiposity were quantified at baseline and post-supplementation .

"BACKGROUND	Functional constipation ( FC ) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGIDs ) which has a major impact on the quality of life . BACKGROUND	Acupuncture is widely used as an alternative and complementary medicine ( CAM ) for FC , but the available evidence of its effectiveness is scarce . BACKGROUND	Therefore , we will perform a randomized controlled trial to determine whether acupuncture improves symptom and quality of life in FC patients more effectively than sham acupuncture or gastrointestinal prokinetic agent . BACKGROUND	This article will report the protocol of the trial . METHODS	The current trial is a multicenter , randomized , three-arm controlled study undergoing in China . METHODS	About 243 people who aged from 18 to 65years with FC will be recruited in this study . METHODS	These participants will be randomly allocated into three treatment groups , including electro-acupuncture ( EA ) , Mosapride ( M ) and Mosapride & Sham Electro-acupuncture ( MS ) groups in a 1:1:1 ratio . METHODS	Both the EA and sham EA receives 16 sessions of needling at Quchi ( LI11 ) and Shangjuxu ( ST37 ) during 4weeks of treatment , and a follow-up period of 4weeks . METHODS	These groups will be compared on the primary outcomes of the number of times of defecation at baseline and 2 , 4 , 8weeks after randomization . METHODS	The secondary outcome measures include : stool consistency , intensity of defecating difficulty , MOS item Short Form health survey ( SF-36 ) , Self-Rating Anxiety Scale ( SAS ) , Self-rating Depression Scale ( SDS ) , and the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life ( PAC-QOL ) . METHODS	These outcomes are measured at baseline and 2 , 4weeks after randomization , but SF-36 is measured at baseline and 4weeks after randomization . CONCLUSIONS	This study will supply significant evidence for using acupuncture to treat FC , and will help us to observe whether it is a therapeutic effect rather than a placebo effect ."
"BACKGROUND	The value of aspirin in primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remains unclear . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to identify women who benefit from alternate-day aspirin with regard to all relevant outcomes , including cancer , CVD and major gastrointestinal bleeding . METHODS	Long term follow-up data of 27939 healthy women with baseline plasma samples in the Women 's Health Study , a randomised trial of 100mg alternate-day aspirin versus placebo , were used to develop competing risks models for individualised prediction of absolute risk reduction of the combination of CVD , cancer and major gastrointestinal bleeding by aspirin . RESULTS	Although aspirin was associated with a modestly decreased 15-year risk of colorectal cancer , CVD , and in some women non-colorectal cancer , aspirin treatment resulted in a negative treatment effect in the majority of women if gastrointestinal bleeding was also taken into account . RESULTS	The excess risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding by aspirin increased with age , but the benefits for colorectal cancer and CVD risk were also greater at higher age . RESULTS	Decision curves indicated that selective treatment of women 65years may improve net benefit compared to treating all , none and prediction-based treatment . RESULTS	The observed 15-year number needed to treat to prevent one event among women 65years was 29 ( 95 % CI 12 to 102 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Concurrent evaluation of the absolute effects on cancer , CVD and major gastrointestinal bleeding showed that alternate-day use of low-dose aspirin is ineffective or harmful in the majority of women in primary prevention . CONCLUSIONS	Selective treatment of women 65years with aspirin may improve net benefit . BACKGROUND	NCT00000479 ."
"BACKGROUND	Hyangaa-Pyeongwi san is the most well known description in Traditional Chinese Medicine for treating functional gastrointestinal disorders . BACKGROUND	Functional dyspepsia ( FD ) is a main concern of intimidating quality of life ( QoL ) in recent days . BACKGROUND	Although many medicines have been developed to improve FD symptoms as well as QoL , there are no potential drugs and treatments for FD . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Hyangaa-Pyeongwi san ( HPS ) on QoL of patients with FD . METHODS	This study was designed as a randomized , double blinded , placebo controlled , and parallel group trial . METHODS	Participants received either placebo or HPS ( 9.68 g of HPS at once , three times daily ) for 4-weeks , and the efficacy evaluations were performed by assessing the Nepean Dyspepsia Index ( NDI ) and functional dyspepsia-quality of life ( FD-QoL ) at 0 - , 4 - and 8-weeks . RESULTS	Total of 170 patients participated and were randomly allocated into placebo or HPS groups . RESULTS	Total symptom score of NDI decreased after 4-weeks trial in both groups ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	HPS significantly improved QoL scores , especially in the area of ` interference and eat/drink ' in NDI ( p = 0.0031 ) as well as ` liveliness status ' , ` role-functioning status ' , and total score in FD-QoL ( p = 0.026 for liveliness status and p = 0.035 for role-functioning status ) . RESULTS	This significant improvement of FD-QoL had lasted for 4-weeks . CONCLUSIONS	HPS treatment is markedly effective in improving QoL in patients with FD . CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , we observed that this improvement had lasted for 4 weeks after finishing the trial through the follow-up study ."
"BACKGROUND	Gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) is a potentially life-threatening complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . BACKGROUND	Since therapeutic options are still limited , a prophylactic approach seems to be warranted . METHODS	In this randomised , double-blind-phase III trial , we evaluated the efficacy of budesonide in the prophylaxis of acute intestinal GvHD after SCT . METHODS	The trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov , number NCT00180089 . RESULTS	The crude incidence of histological or clinical stage 3-4 acute intestinal GvHD until day 100 observed in 91 ( n = 48 budesonide , n = 43 placebo ) evaluable patients was 12.5 % ( 95 % CI 3-22 % ) under treatment with budesonide and 14 % ( 95 % CI 4-25 % ) under placebo ( p = 0.888 ) . RESULTS	Histologic and clinical stage 3-4 intestinal GvHD after 12 months occurred in 17 % ( 95 % CI 6-28 % ) of patients in the budesonide group and 19 % ( CI 7-32 % ) in the placebo group ( p = 0.853 ) . RESULTS	Although budesonide was tolerated well , we observed a trend towards a higher rate of infectious complications in the study group ( 47.9 % versus 30.2 % , p = 0.085 ) . RESULTS	The cumulative incidences at 12 months of intestinal GvHD stage > 2 with death as a competing event ( budesonide 20.8 % vs. placebo 32.6 % , p = 0.250 ) and the cumulative incidence of relapse ( budesonide 20.8 % vs. placebo 16.3 % , p = 0.547 ) and non-relapse mortality ( budesonide 28 % ( 95 % CI 15-41 % ) vs. placebo 30 % ( 95 % CI 15-44 % ) , showed no significant difference within the two groups ( p = 0.911 ) . RESULTS	The trial closed after 94 patients were enrolled because of slow accrual . RESULTS	Within the limits of the final sample size , we were unable to show any benefit for the addition of budesonide to standard GvHD prophylaxis . CONCLUSIONS	Budesonide did not decrease the occurrence of intestinal GvHD in this trial . CONCLUSIONS	These results imply most likely that prophylactic administration of budenoside with pH-modified release in the terminal ileum is not effective ."
"BACKGROUND	Diclofenac is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis ( OA ) ; however , like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) it can be associated with serious dose-related adverse events ( AEs ) . BACKGROUND	Low-dose SoluMatrix diclofenac has been developed to provide efficacy at lower diclofenac doses . BACKGROUND	A recently published Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SoluMatrix diclofenac 35 mg twice daily ( b.i.d. ) and thrice daily ( t.i.d. ) in patients with OA pain treated for 12 weeks . METHODS	This Phase III multicenter , open-label study assessed the safety of SoluMatrix diclofenac in patients with OA dosed up to 52 weeks ( ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT01510912 ) . METHODS	The study enrolled 602 chronic NSAID/acetaminophen users , aged 40 years with OA of the knee or hip . METHODS	Patients received SoluMatrix diclofenac 35 mg b.i.d. , which could be increased to t.i.d. and subsequently reduced to b.i.d. as needed . METHODS	Safety assessments included AEs , vital signs , physical examination findings , 12-lead electrocardiogram , and clinical laboratory test results . METHODS	Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated by the Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) . RESULTS	A total of 601 patients received SoluMatrix diclofenac ; 373 of 601 patients ( 62.1 % ) received treatment for 11 months . RESULTS	The most frequent AEs included upper respiratory tract infection , headache , urinary tract infection , diarrhea , nasopharyngitis , and nausea . RESULTS	Serious gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , renal , and hepatic AEs were uncommon . RESULTS	A small proportion ( 99 patients , 16.5 % ) of patients discontinued participation in the study due to AEs . RESULTS	Clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in Physical Component Summary Scores of the SF-36 were noted at week 12 and were sustained through week 52 . RESULTS	Improvements in six of the eight individual physical and mental SF-36 domains were also noted . CONCLUSIONS	SoluMatrix diclofenac treatment for up to 1 year was generally well tolerated in patients with OA pain and associated with improvement in quality of life measures . BACKGROUND	www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier : NCT01510912 ."
"OBJECTIVE	Distress screening guidelines call for rapid screening for emotional distress at the time of cancer diagnosis . OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to examine the distress thermometer 's ( DT ) ability to screen in patients in treatment for advanced cancer who may be depressed . METHODS	Using cross-sectional data collected from patients within 30 days of diagnosis with advanced cancer , this study used ROC analysis to determine the optimal-cutoff point of the distress thermometer ( DT ) for screening for depression as measured by the physician health questionnaire ( PHQ ) -9 ; inter-test reliability analysis to compare the DT with the PHQ-2 for screening in possible cases of depression , and multivariate analysis to examine associations among the DT emotional problem list ( EPL ) items with cases of depression . RESULTS	The average age of the 123 patients in the study was 59.9 ( 12.9 ) years . RESULTS	Seventy ( 56.9 % ) were female . RESULTS	All had Stage 3 or 4 cancers ( 40 % gastrointestinal , 19 % gynecologic , 20 % head and neck , 21 % lung ) . RESULTS	The mean DT score was 4 ( 2.7 ) / 10 ; and 56 ( 43 % ) were depressed as measured by the PHQ-9 5 . RESULTS	The optimal DT cut-off score to screen in possible cases of depression was 2/10 , with a sensitivity of .96 , compared to a sensitivity of .32 of the PHQ-2 2 . RESULTS	Correlation coefficients for the DT 2 and the PHQ-2 with the PHQ-9 5 were 0.4 and -0.2 , respectively . RESULTS	EPL items associated with cases of depression were Depression ( OR = 0.15 , 0.02-0 .85 ) and Sadness ( OR = 0.21 , 0.06-0 .72 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The optimal DT threshold for identifying possible cases of depression at the time of diagnosis is 2 ; this threshold is more sensitive than the PHQ-2 2 . CONCLUSIONS	EPL items may be used with the DT score to triage patients for evaluation ."
"BACKGROUND	There is a paucity of evidence documenting the pathogenicity of Dientamoeba fragilis , an intestinal protozoan common in children . BACKGROUND	As case reports on successful treatment are numerous , many authors advocate treatment , despite no placebo-controlled trials being available . BACKGROUND	Metronidazole is often used for treatment , though eradication rates are relatively low ( 60 % -80 % ) . BACKGROUND	In the present study we determined the clinical and microbiological efficacy of metronidazole in Danish children . METHODS	In this parallel placebo-controlled double-blinded trial , children aged 3-12 years with > 4 weeks of gastrointestinal symptoms were allocated using block randomization in a 1:1 ratio to a 10-day course of oral metronidazole or placebo . METHODS	Primary outcome was change in level of gastrointestinal symptoms , measured on a visual-analog-scale ( VAS ) , and secondary outcome was eradication of D. fragilis infection . METHODS	Participants , caregivers , investigators , and sponsor were all blinded to group assignment . METHODS	The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01314976 ) prior to start . RESULTS	Of 96 participants , 48 were allocated to the metronidazole and placebo group each . RESULTS	Mean VAS change from pre - to post-treatment did not differ significantly ( P = .8 ) between the metronidazole ( -1.8 CI , [ -2.5 , -1.1 ] ) and the placebo group ( -1.6 CI , [ -2.3 , -.9 ] ) . RESULTS	Eradication of D. fragilis was significantly greater in the metronidazole group , although it declined rapidly from 62.5 % 2 weeks after end of treatment to 24.9 % 8 weeks after end of treatment . CONCLUSIONS	These findings do not provide evidence to support routine metronidazole treatment of D. fragilis positive children with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms . CONCLUSIONS	Study funded by Statens Serum Institut . BACKGROUND	Trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01314976 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	The effectiveness of chest compressions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) is affected by the rescuer 's position with respect to the patient . BACKGROUND	In hospitals , chest compressions are typically performed while standing beside the patient , who is placed on a bed . OBJECTIVE	To compare the effectiveness of chest compressions , performed on a bed during 2 min of CPR , among three different rescuer positions : standing , on a footstool , or kneeling on the bed . METHODS	We performed a crossover randomized simulation trial . METHODS	Participants were recruited from among students in the Department of Paramedics from July to August 2011 . METHODS	Thirty-eight participants were enrolled , and they performed chest compressions on a mannequin for 2 min in each of the three different positions , with a 1-week interval between each position . RESULTS	The number of adequate compressions ( depth > 50 mm ) and the mean compression depth were significantly greater in the kneeling and footstool positions than in the standing position , but there was no significant difference between the kneeling and footstool positions . RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the compression rate , the percentage of correctly released compressions , and the percentage of compressions performed using the correct hand position among the three rescuer positions . CONCLUSIONS	The mean compression depth and the number of adequate compressions were greater for both the kneeling and footstool positions than for the standing position during 2 min of CPR . CONCLUSIONS	We recommend kneeling on a bed or standing on a footstool as the rescuer positions during hospital CPR on a bed ."
"BACKGROUND	The benefit or harm of trabectedin discontinuation in patients with non-progressive soft-tissue sarcoma remains unclear . BACKGROUND	We report the final analysis of a phase 2 trial investigating the clinical benefit of continuation of trabectedin treatment until progression versus interruption of therapy after six treatment cycles in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma . METHODS	For this open-label , non-comparative , multicentre , phase 2 study , eligible adult patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas , who had previously received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and were able to receive trabectedin , were enrolled from 14 centres of the French Sarcoma Group . METHODS	Trabectedin was administered at a dose of 15 mg/m ( 2 ) through a central venous line as a 24-h continuous infusion every 3 weeks . METHODS	After the initial six cycles of trabectedin , patients who were free from progressive disease were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to continuous treatment or therapy interruption . METHODS	Randomisation was done centrally by a computer-generated system using permuted blocks of four patients , stratified by tumour grade and performance status . METHODS	Patients allocated to the interruption group were allowed to restart trabectedin in case of progressive disease . METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months after randomisation , analysed by intention to treat . METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01303094 . RESULTS	In 178 evaluable patients , 91 ( 51 % ) patients had not progressed after six cycles . RESULTS	Of these patients , 53 patients were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups : 27 to the continuation group and 26 to the interruption group . RESULTS	Overall , patients in the two groups received a similar median number of trabectedin cycles ( continuation group : 11 cycles [ range 6-31 + ] vs interruption group : 11 [ range 6-23 + ] ) . RESULTS	After randomisation , progression-free survival at 6 months was 519 % ( 95 % CI 319-686 ) in the continuation group versus 231 % ( 94-403 ) in the interruption group ( p = 00200 ) . RESULTS	The occurrence of treatment-related grade 3 adverse events ( four [ 16 % ] of 25 patients in the continuation group vs three [ 14 % ] of 21 in the interruption group ) and grade 4 adverse events ( one [ 4 % ] vs none ) was similar in both groups . RESULTS	The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities were alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase increases ( one [ 4 % ] in the interruption group vs three [ 14 % ] in the continuation group ) , neutropenia ( two [ 8 % ] vs two [ 10 % ] ) , and intestinal occlusion ( one [ 4 % ] vs one [ 5 % ] ) . CONCLUSIONS	We do not recommend trabectedin discontinuation in patients with advanced , doxorubicin-refractory soft-tissue sarcoma who have not progressed after six cycles of treatment . BACKGROUND	The French National Cancer Institute ( INCa ) and PharmaMar SA ."
"OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of a galacto-oligosaccharides ( GOS ) - supplemented formula on the intestinal microbiota in healthy term infants , with a specific consideration for gastrointestinal symptoms as colic , stool frequency and consistency , regurgitation . METHODS	This was a randomized , double-blind , controlled , parallel-group clinical trial performed simultaneously by 6 centers in Italy . METHODS	Three groups were considered : breastfed , formula-fed , and GOS-supplemented formula-fed infants . METHODS	Formula-fed infants were randomized to receive either the control or the study formula and consume the assigned formula exclusively until the introduction of complementary feeding . METHODS	The nutritional composition of the 2 formulas were identical , apart from the supplemented GOS ( 0.4 g/100mL ) in the study formula . METHODS	Four different types of bacteria were evaluated in order to assess the efficacy of GOS-supplemented formula on infants : Bifidobacterium , Lactobacillus , and Clostridium , Escherichia coli . RESULTS	A total of 199 breastfed infants and 163 formula-fed infants were recruited . RESULTS	When considering stool frequency and consistency , GOS-supplemented formula presented normal and soft stools in the majority of episodes ( 89 % ) . RESULTS	In the supplemented group the incidence of colic was lower with respect to the control group . RESULTS	A significantly lower count of Clostridium and a higher count of Bifidobacterium were found when comparing study formula and control formula in infants with colic . RESULTS	In children with colic the ratio between Clostridium count and Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus count was in favor of the latter two when considering the GOS-supplemented formula group with respect to the control one . CONCLUSIONS	The prebiotic-supplemented formula mimicked the effect of human milk in promoting Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus growth and in inhibiting Clostridium growth , resulting in a significantly lower presence of colic ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of growing-up milk ( GUM ) with added short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides ( scGOS ) / long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides ( lcFOS ) ( 9:1 ) ( Immunofortis ) and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LCPUFAs ) on the occurrence of infections in healthy children attending day care centres . METHODS	In a randomised double-blind controlled , parallel , multicountry intervention study , 767 healthy children , ages 11 to 29 months , received GUM with scGOS/lcFOS/LCPUFAs ( the active group , n = 388 ) , GUM without scGOS/lcFOS/LCPUFAs ( the control group , n = 379 ) , or cow 's milk ( n = 37 ) for 52 weeks . METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the number of episodes of upper respiratory tract infections or gastrointestinal infections based on a combination of subject 's illness symptoms reported by the parents during the intervention period . RESULTS	Children in the active group compared with the control group had a decreased risk of developing at least 1 infection ( 299/388 [ 77 % ] vs 313/379 [ 83 % ] , respectively , relative risk 0.93 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.87-1 .00 ; logistic regression P = 0.03 ) . RESULTS	There was a trend toward a reduction ( P = 0.07 ) in the total number of infections in the active group , which was significant when confirmed by one of the investigators ( 268/388 [ 69 % ] vs 293/379 [ 77 % ] , respectively , relative risk 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.82-0 .97 ; P = 0.004 , post hoc ) . RESULTS	More infectious episodes were observed in the cow 's milk group , when compared with both GUM groups ( 34/37 [ 92 % ] vs 612/767 [ 80 % ] , respectively , relative risk 1.15 , 95 % CI 1.04-1 .28 ) . CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study in children to show a reduced risk of infection following consumption of GUM supplemented with scGOS/lcFOS/n -3 LCPUFAs . CONCLUSIONS	The borderline statistical significance justifies a new study to confirm this finding ."
"OBJECTIVE	To test efficacy and durability of a polyphenol-based prebiotic treatment for acute gastroenteritis in a 300 patient double-blinded clinical study . METHODS	A two-arm randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted at two public health centers in Managua , Nicaragua . METHODS	Potential subjects who qualified based on inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms . METHODS	Two thirds of the subjects ( n = 200 ) received a single titrated 0.5-2 ounce liquid dose of a novel polyphenol-based prebiotic ( Aliva ( TM ) ) diluted with 2 to eight ounces of oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) . METHODS	One third of the subjects ( n = 100 ) were randomized to receive two liquid ounces of a taste and color-matched placebo diluted in eight ounces of ORS . METHODS	The outcome variables measured included stool consistency , stomach discomfort , gas and bloating , and heartburn/indigestion . METHODS	The study subjects ranked their stool consistency and the severity of their subjective symptoms at specified intervals from immediately prior to treatment , to five days post treatment . METHODS	All subjects recorded their symptoms in a study diary . METHODS	The study subjects also recorded the time and consistencies of all stools in their study diary . METHODS	Stool consistency was compared to the picture and descriptions on the Bristol Stool Chart , and any stool rated greater than Type 4 was considered unformed . METHODS	The clinical study team reviewed the study diaries with subjects during daily follow-up calls and close-out visits , and recorded the data in case report forms . RESULTS	After receiving a single dose , Aliva treated subjects reported shorter median time to their last unformed stool ( 1 h 50 min ) than placebo treated subjects ( 67 h 50 min . ) RESULTS	, a statistically significant difference [ 95 % CI : -3178 - ( -2018 ) , P = 0.000 ] . RESULTS	Aliva treated subjects also reported shorter median their time to last unformed stool ( TTLUS ) ( 1 hrs 50 min ) than placebo treated subjects ( 67 h 50 min ) , which was also a statistically significant difference ( P = 0.000 ) . RESULTS	The percentage of subjects recording TTLUS was greater for those who received Aliva vs placebo at 30 min ( P = 0.027 ) , 2 h ( P = 0.000 ) , 24 h ( P = 0.000 ) , 48 h ( P = 0.000 ) , 72 h ( P = 0.000 ) , and 5 d ( P = 0.000 ) post dose . RESULTS	There were 146 study subjects 14 years old or older , which was the criteria set for reliable self-reporting of subjective symptoms . RESULTS	Of those 146 subjects , 142 reported stomach pain and discomfort during screening . RESULTS	From 90 minutes [ 95 % CI : -1.8 - ( -0.01 ) , P = 0.048 ] through 5 d [ 95 % CI : -3.4 - ( -1.9 ) , P = 0.000 ) , the subjects treated with Aliva experienced significantly less stomach pain and discomfort than those who received placebo . RESULTS	Of those same 146 participants , 114 subjects reported gas and bloating during screening . RESULTS	Similarly , subjects who received Aliva experienced significantly less gas and bloating from 2 h [ 95 % CI : -1.7 - ( -0.39 ) , P = 0.030 ] through 5 d ( 95 % CI : -2.0 -0.42 , P = 0.005 ) compared with the placebo arm . CONCLUSIONS	In this double-blind , randomized clinical study , subjects with acute gastroenteritis receiving Aliva prebiotic showed significant and sustained improvement of multiple symptoms vs those receiving placebo ."
"BACKGROUND	The weaning period is critical for stress-related diseases and infections . BACKGROUND	Currently , large amounts of therapeutic antimicrobials are used to treat infections in the livestock production , especially in piglets . BACKGROUND	Phytogenic feed additives could provide a useful alternative . BACKGROUND	We hypothesize , that components in agrimonia species which have been used successfully in humans to treat gastrointestinal infections could also improve the health of piglets . BACKGROUND	We investigated the effects of Agrimonia procera ( AP ) on the growth performance of piglets and cytokine expression in isolated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . RESULTS	Here we show that piglets that received a diet with 0.56 g/kg AP for 6 weeks tended to ingest more food ( +5.1 % ; P < 0.10 ) , and were characterized by a higher nitrogen retention ( +9.6 % , P < 0.05 ) than the control group without AP treatment . RESULTS	Data from a second experiment reveal that piglets fed a diet with 0.87 g/kg AP for 6 weeks had an improved food conversion ratio ( 1.46 0.04 ) compared to those that received none ( 1.54 0.08 ) or 8.7 g/kg AP ( 1.60 0.08 ) with their diets ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	However , the food intake , daily weight gain and dry matter of feces were not affected by the AP treatment . RESULTS	Treatment of PBMC for 1 and 6 h with AP extract ( APE ) reduced the mRNA abundance of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) ? RESULTS	in cells challenged with lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) but not in cells without LPS stimulation ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The lower mRNA expression of TNF ? RESULTS	was accompanied by a trend towards a lower release of TNF ? RESULTS	from these cells ( P ? RESULTS	= ? RESULTS	0.067 ) . RESULTS	After the treatment of PBMC with APE for 6 h , the relative mRNA concentration of interleukin ( IL ) -1 ? RESULTS	declined ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas that of IL-10 remained unchanged . RESULTS	Treatment of LPS-challenged PBMC for 20 h with varying concentrations of APE did not reveal any effect on cytokine expression and TNF ? RESULTS	release . CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that low dosages of AP may improve the growth performance of piglets and seem to exert antiinflammatory effects in porcine immune cells challenged with LPS ."
"BACKGROUND	Postinfectious cough is common in primary care , but has no proven effective treatments . BACKGROUND	Cysteinyl leukotrienes are involved in the pathogenesis of postinfectious cough and whooping cough ( pertussis ) . BACKGROUND	We investigated the effectiveness of montelukast , a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist , in the treatment of postinfectious cough . METHODS	In this randomised , placebo-controlled trial , non-smoking adults aged 16-49 years with postinfectious cough of 2-8 weeks ' duration were recruited from 25 general practices in England . METHODS	Patients were tested for pertussis ( oral fluid anti-pertussis toxin IgG ) and randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to montelukast 10 mg daily or image-matched placebo for 2 weeks . METHODS	Patients chose whether to continue study drug for another 2 weeks . METHODS	The randomisation sequence was computer-generated and stratified by general practice . METHODS	Patients , health-care professionals , and researchers were masked to treatment allocation . METHODS	Effectiveness was assessed with the Leicester Cough Questionnaire to measure changes in cough-specific quality of life ; the primary outcomes were changes in total score between baseline and two follow-up stages ( 2 weeks and 4 weeks ) . METHODS	The primary analysis was by intention to treat with imputation by last observation carried forward . METHODS	Recruitment closed on Sept 21 , 2012 , and follow-up has been completed . METHODS	This trial is registered with EudraCT ( 2010-019647-19 ) , UKCRN Portfolio ( ID 8360 ) , and ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01279668 ) . RESULTS	From April 13 , 2011 , to Sept 21 , 2012 , we randomly assigned 276 patients to montelukast ( n = 137 ) or placebo ( n = 139 ) . RESULTS	70 ( 25 % ) patients had laboratory-confirmed pertussis . RESULTS	Improvements in cough-specific quality of life occurred in both groups after 2 weeks ( montelukast : mean 27 , 95 % CI 22-33 ; placebo : 36 , 29-43 ) , but the difference between groups did not meet the minimum clinically important difference of 13 ( mean difference -09 , -17 to -004 , p = 004 ) . RESULTS	This difference was not statistically significant in any sensitivity analyses . RESULTS	After 2 weeks , 192 of 259 participants from whom data were available elected to continue study drug ( 99 [ 77 % ] of 129 participants on montelukast ; 93 [ 72 % ] of 130 on placebo ) . RESULTS	After 4 weeks , there were no significant between-group differences in cough-specific quality of life improvement ( montelukast : 52 , 45-59 ; placebo : 59 , 51-67 ; mean difference -05 , -15 to 06 , p = 038 ) or adverse event rates ( 21 ( 15 % ) of 137 patients on montelukast reported one or more adverse events ; 31 ( 22 % ) of 139 on placebo ; p = 014 ) . RESULTS	The most common adverse events reported were increased mucus production ( montelukast , n = 6 ; placebo , n = 2 ) , gastrointestinal disturbance ( montelukast , n = 3 ; placebo , n = 5 ) , and headache ( montelukast , n = 2 ; placebo , n = 6 ) . RESULTS	One serious adverse event was reported ( placebo , n = 1 ) , which was unrelated to study drug ( shortness of breath and throat tightness after severe coughing bouts ) . CONCLUSIONS	Montelukast is not an effective treatment for postinfectious cough . CONCLUSIONS	However , the burden of postinfectious cough in primary care is high , making it an ideal setting for future antitussive treatment trials .

"OBJECTIVE	To assess the safety and tolerability of high-dose creatine , the feasibility of enrolling premanifest and 50 % at-risk subjects in a prevention trial , and the potential of cognitive , imaging , and blood markers . METHODS	Sixty-four eligible consenting participants were randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) to 15 g twice daily of creatine monohydrate or placebo for a 6-month double-blind phase followed by a 12-month open-label extension . METHODS	Subjects included premanifest ( tested ) and at-risk ( not tested ) individuals without clinical symptoms or signs of Huntington disease ( HD ) . METHODS	Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability . METHODS	Exploratory endpoints included fine motor , visuospatial , and memory performance ; structural and diffusion MRI ; and selected blood markers . RESULTS	Forty-seven HD carriers and 17 non-HD controls were enrolled . RESULTS	Fifteen discontinued treatment ( 2 assigned to placebo ) ; all were followed for the entire study period . RESULTS	Primary analysis was by intent to treat . RESULTS	The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal . RESULTS	Neuroimaging demonstrated treatment-related slowing of cortical and striatal atrophy at 6 and 18 months . CONCLUSIONS	We describe a design that preserves the autonomy of subjects not wanting genetic testing while including controls for assessing the specificity of treatment effects . CONCLUSIONS	Our results demonstrate the feasibility of prevention trials for HD and the safety of high-dose creatine , provide possible evidence of disease modification , support future studies of creatine , and illustrate the value of prodromal biomarkers . METHODS	This study provides Class I evidence that high-dose creatine is safe and tolerable ."
"OBJECTIVE	Semagacestat , a - secretase inhibitor , demonstrated an unfavorable risk-benefit profile in a Phase 3 study of patients with Alzheimer 's disease ( IDENTITY trials ) , and clinical development was halted . OBJECTIVE	To assist in future development of - secretase inhibitors , we report detailed safety findings from the IDENTITY study , with emphasis on those that might be mechanistically linked to - secretase inhibition . METHODS	The IDENTITY trial was a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of semagacestat ( 100mg and 140mg ) , in which 1537 patients age 55 years and older with probable Alzheimer 's disease were randomized . METHODS	Treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are reported by body system along with pertinent laboratory , vital sign , and ECG findings . RESULTS	Semagacestat treatment was associated with increased reporting of suspected Notch-related adverse events ( gastrointestinal , infection , and skin cancer related ) . RESULTS	Other relevant safety findings associated with semagacestat treatment included cognitive and functional worsening , skin-related TEAEs , renal and hepatic changes , increased QT interval , and weight loss . RESULTS	With few exceptions , differences between semagacestat and placebo treatment groups were no longer significant after cessation of treatment with active drug . CONCLUSIONS	Many of these safety findings can be attributed to - secretase inhibition , and may be valuable to researchers developing - secretase inhibitors ."
"BACKGROUND	Leaky gut , or intestinal permeability , is the phenomenon of the gut wall exhibiting increased absorbency . BACKGROUND	It is pretty well recognised that an altered or damaged bowel lining or gut wall may result from unbalanced diet , parasites , infection , or medications and that this allows substances such as toxins , microbes , undigested food , or waste to leak through . BACKGROUND	As a natural consequence , this prompts the body to initiate an immune reaction leading to potentially severe health conditions . BACKGROUND	Different strategies may be used to improve , at least temporarily , the physiological intestinal barrier . BACKGROUND	The use of specific beneficial microorganisms , such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria , has been suggested as an innovative tool to counteract an improper level of intestinal permeability . BACKGROUND	The association of bacteria with specific gelling agents , such as gums , may represent an improvement since these molecules are able to form hydrophilic gels that distribute uniformly over the inner intestinal surface . BACKGROUND	This pilot study was undertaken to evaluate intestinal permeability in subjects treated with a gelling complex , an association of tara gum and the microorganism Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 ( DSM 25246 ) , which has a well-demonstrated in vitro ability to synthesise and secrete exopolysaccharides ( EPSs ) . METHODS	Twenty-five healthy subjects were enrolled in this human intervention , double-blind , placebo-controlled , pilot trial ( age between 21 and 57 y , mean 37.711.2 ) . METHODS	Subjects were then randomised into 2 groups : group A ( 13 subjects ) was given an active formulation containing 250 mg of tara gum and 1 billion viable cells of S. thermophilus ST10 , whereas group B ( 12 subjects ) was given a placebo formulation . METHODS	All the subjects participating in the study were directed to take 1 dose per day for 30 consecutive days . METHODS	The presence and concentration of exopolysaccharides ( EPSs ) in the faeces was determined at time 0 ( d0 ) , after 30 days of treatment ( d30 ) , and at the end of the 2-week follow-up period ( d45 ) . METHODS	The monosaccharide composition of EPSs was used to quantify the possible contribution of tara gum to the amount of polysaccharides detected in the faecal material . METHODS	Intestinal permeability was evaluated at the same time by means of the lactitol/mannitol ratio ( small intestine permeability ) and sucralose concentration ( colonic permeability ) in urine specimens sampled after specified times . METHODS	A statistical comparison was made between the concentration of EPSs , the lactulose/mannitol ratio , and the amount of excreted sucralose in the 2 groups at d0 , d30 , and d45 . RESULTS	In the active group , supplementation with S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum was able to significantly increase the faecal EPSs concentration compared with placebo ( from 0.169 mg/g to 0.633 mg/g after 30 d , P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	An interesting decrease in intestinal permeability , both of the small bowel and in the colon , was also recorded . RESULTS	The L/M ratio diminished from 0.021 in the active group to 0.014 and 0.015 after 30 and 45 days , respectively ( P = 0.045 and P = 0.033 compared with placebo ) . RESULTS	The sucralose concentration decreased from 35.8 mg to 27.9 mg and 29.1 mg ( P = 0.038 and P = 0.026 compared with placebo ) at the end of the supplementation period and after the follow-up , respectively . RESULTS	No significant differences were recorded in the placebo after 30 days or at the end of the follow-up . CONCLUSIONS	The association of the EPSs produced by S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum seems capable of significantly improving the intestinal functional barrier in healthy subjects . CONCLUSIONS	A wider study in subjects presenting impaired gut permeability would be useful in the future to confirm the positive results from this pilot trial . CONCLUSIONS	In any case , our findings are consistent with the parallel increase in exopolysaccharide concentration in the faecal material , thus suggesting the effective ability of the strain used to secrete EPSs in the gut lumen . CONCLUSIONS	An innovative approach of this type may be useful in helping to restore the physiological barrier by means of a merely natural and mechanical action ."
"OBJECTIVE	An imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells is involved in allergic rhinitis ( AR ) that may be improved by probiotics . OBJECTIVE	To test the efficacy of the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei subsp . OBJECTIVE	paracasei LP-33 , a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial was carried out in patients with AR to grass pollen treated with loratadine and presenting altered quality of life . METHODS	Subjects with persistent AR , symptomatic during the grass pollen season , and a positive skin test or specific immunoglobulin E to grass pollens were included by general practitioners ( GPs ) . METHODS	All received loratadine for 5 weeks . METHODS	The primary end point was the improvement in Rhinitis Quality of Life ( RQLQ ) global score at the fifth week of LP-33 consumption compared with placebo ( in addition to loratadine ) . METHODS	Secondary end points included nasal and ocular symptoms ( individual and total symptom scores ) , visual analogue scale and time of first exacerbation of the symptoms when loratadine was stopped . RESULTS	A total of 425 subjects were included . RESULTS	Using intent-to-treat analysis , the RQLQ global score decreased significantly more in the LP-33 group than in the placebo group ( P = 0.0255 , difference = -0.286 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : -0.536 ; -0.035 ) ) . RESULTS	No significant differences were noted for the change of the rhinitis total symptom score 5 global score between groups ( P = 0.1288 , difference = -0.452 ( 95 % CI : -1.036 ; 0.132 ) ) . RESULTS	Significant differences in ocular symptoms ( RQLQ ) were observed between groups ( P = 0.0029 , difference = -0.4087 ( 95 % CI : -0.6768 ; -0.1407 ) ) . CONCLUSIONS	This study performed by GPs shows that LP-33 improves the quality of life of subjects with persistent AR who are currently being treated with an oral H1-antihistamine . CONCLUSIONS	Whereas nasal symptoms had not changed , ocular symptoms had consistently improved ."
"BACKGROUND	HIV-associated diarrhea remains a significant concern with limited treatment options . OBJECTIVE	To determine the optimal dose , efficacy , and safety of crofelemer for noninfectious diarrhea . METHODS	This randomized , double-blind , phase 3 trial used a 2-stage design . METHODS	Both stages included 2-week screening , 4-week placebo-controlled treatment , and 20-week placebo-free ( open-label ) extension phases . METHODS	In stage I , 196 HIV-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhea were randomized to crofelemer 125 mg , 250 mg , or 500 mg or placebo twice daily . METHODS	Using a prospective analysis , the 125-mg twice-daily dose was selected for stage II . METHODS	In stage II , 180 new patients were randomized to crofelemer 125 mg twice daily or placebo for 4 weeks . METHODS	Primary efficacy analysis was the percentage of patients ( stages I/II combined ) who achieved clinical response ( defined as 2 watery stools/week during 2 of 4 weeks ) . METHODS	During the placebo-free extension phase , response ( 2 watery stools ) was assessed weekly . RESULTS	Significantly more patients receiving crofelemer 125 mg achieved clinical response versus placebo ( 17.6 % vs 8.0 % ; one-sided , P = .01 ) . RESULTS	Crofelemer 125 mg resulted in a greater change from baseline in number of daily watery bowel movements ( P = .04 ) and daily stool consistency score ( P = .02 ) versus placebo . RESULTS	During the placebo-free extension phase , percentages of weekly responders ranged from 40 % to 56 % at weeks 11 to 24 . RESULTS	Crofelemer was minimally absorbed , well tolerated , did not negatively impact clinical immune parameters , and had a safety profile comparable to placebo . CONCLUSIONS	In HIV-seropositive patients taking stable antiretroviral therapy , crofelemer provided significant improvement in diarrhea with a favorable safety profile ."
"BACKGROUND	Whether a restrictive threshold for hemoglobin level in red-cell transfusions , as compared with a liberal threshold , reduces postoperative morbidity and health care costs after cardiac surgery is uncertain . METHODS	We conducted a multicenter , parallel-group trial in which patients older than 16 years of age who were undergoing nonemergency cardiac surgery were recruited from 17 centers in the United Kingdom . METHODS	Patients with a postoperative hemoglobin level of less than 9 g per deciliter were randomly assigned to a restrictive transfusion threshold ( hemoglobin level < 7.5 g per deciliter ) or a liberal transfusion threshold ( hemoglobin level < 9 g per deciliter ) . METHODS	The primary outcome was a serious infection ( sepsis or wound infection ) or an ischemic event ( permanent stroke [ confirmation on brain imaging and deficit in motor , sensory , or coordination functions ] , myocardial infarction , infarction of the gut , or acute kidney injury ) within 3 months after randomization . METHODS	Health care costs , excluding the index surgery , were estimated from the day of surgery to 3 months after surgery . RESULTS	A total of 2007 patients underwent randomization ; 4 participants withdrew , leaving 1000 in the restrictive-threshold group and 1003 in the liberal-threshold group . RESULTS	Transfusion rates after randomization were 53.4 % and 92.2 % in the two groups , respectively . RESULTS	The primary outcome occurred in 35.1 % of the patients in the restrictive-threshold group and 33.0 % of the patients in the liberal-threshold group ( odds ratio , 1.11 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.91 to 1.34 ; P = 0.30 ) ; there was no indication of heterogeneity according to subgroup . RESULTS	There were more deaths in the restrictive-threshold group than in the liberal-threshold group ( 4.2 % vs. 2.6 % ; hazard ratio , 1.64 ; 95 % CI , 1.00 to 2.67 ; P = 0.045 ) . RESULTS	Serious postoperative complications , excluding primary-outcome events , occurred in 35.7 % of participants in the restrictive-threshold group and 34.2 % of participants in the liberal-threshold group . RESULTS	Total costs did not differ significantly between the groups . CONCLUSIONS	A restrictive transfusion threshold after cardiac surgery was not superior to a liberal threshold with respect to morbidity or health care costs .

"BACKGROUND	Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that are able to colonize the host digestive system , increasing the natural flora and preventing colonization of pathogenic organisms and thus , securing optimal utility of the feed . BACKGROUND	However , commercial probiotic often do not meet the expected standards and the viability of the efficacy of these strains remains questionable . BACKGROUND	Another major issue has been highlighted in relation to the application of antibiotic resistant probiotics , the antibiotic resistant gene can be transferred between organisms . BACKGROUND	Recently , postbiotic metabolites produced from microbes have been extensively studied as feed additive in order to substitute in-feed antibiotics . RESULTS	No significant difference ( P > 0.05 ) was found among the treatment groups on overall feed intake , egg weight , egg mass and feed conversion efficiency . RESULTS	COM456 had a significant reduction ( P < 0.05 ) in faecal pH compared to the other groups at 28 weeks of age onwards . RESULTS	COM456 had significant higher ( P < 0.05 ) level of lactic acid bacteria counts from 30 weeks of age onwards , followed by COM246 and COM345 at 32 and 34 weeks of age , respectively . RESULTS	Significant reduction of faecal Enterobacteriaceae ( P < 0.05 ) were observed in COM246 and COM456 from 30 weeks of age onwards . RESULTS	The lowest levels ( P < 0.05 ) of plasma and egg yolk cholesterol were observed in COM456 , followed by COM345 and COM246 . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in terms of yolk weight between the treatment groups . RESULTS	Significant higher ( P < 0.05 ) content of C18 :3 , C20 :2 and C22 :6 were found in treatments supplemented with metabolite combinations as compared with the control group . CONCLUSIONS	The present study demonstrated the positive effects of metabolite combinations supplementation in laying hens . CONCLUSIONS	Increase in hen-day egg production was observed in all treatments supplemented with metabolite combinations . CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the metabolite combinations , COM456 had reduced the faecal pH and faecal Enterobacteriaceae population , improved the faecal lactic acid bacteria , reduced the plasma and yolk cholesterol and improved the faecal volatile fatty acids content . CONCLUSIONS	Postbiotic metabolite combinations can be used as an alternative feed additive to achieve high productivity and better animal health while reducing the use of conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as in-feed antimicrobials ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the influence of different pressures of CO2 pneumoperitioneum on pathomorphism and function of intestines following laparoscopic gastrectomy ( LG ) . METHODS	Forty-eight gastric cancer patients were prospectively enrolled in the study . METHODS	Among them , 36 patients scheduled for elective LG were randomly assigned to low pressure group ( LP ) , middle pressure ( MP ) , and high pressure group ( HP ) with 12 cases in each group . METHODS	The CO2 pneumoperitoneum pressure was maintained at 8-10 mmhg in LP , 11-13 mmhg in MP , and 14-16 mmhg in HP . METHODS	The control group was open gastrectomy group ( OG ) in 12 cases . METHODS	The intestinal pathomorphism and level of plasma D-lactic acid before , during and after operation , and postoperative intestinal function of four groups were examined and compared . RESULTS	There were no statistical differences in preoperative data among the four groups ( all P > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	LG group was associated with a lower rate of surgical complications than OG ( 8.3 % vs. 41.7 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	No obvious damage of intestinal mucosa was found in OG group . RESULTS	Damage degree of intestinal mucosa after operation in LP , MP and HP groups was 0-1 , 1-2 , and 2-3 respectively . RESULTS	There was significant change in intestinal pathomorphism after operation in both HP and MP groups . RESULTS	The levels of D-lactic acid before operation were not significantly different among all the four groups , but increased significantly in each group after operation ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	HP group had the highest level of plasma D-lactic acid and presented with delayed bowel sound return ( 4.5 d ) , time to first flatus ( 5.4 d ) , and intake ( 6.0 d ) as compared to the other 3 groups ( all P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Laparoscopic radical gastrectomy is safe and minimally invasive . CONCLUSIONS	Higher pneumoperitoneal pressure is harmful to the recovery of intestinal mucosa and function . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore the pneumoperitioneum pressure should be maintained as low as possible under clear visualization during operation ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of canagliflozin and metformin following administration of a canagliflozin/metformin ( 150/1 ,000 mg ) immediate-release ( IR ) fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) tablet . METHODS	A randomized , open-label , singlecenter , single-dose , 2-period , 2-sequence crossover study was conducted in healthy participants . METHODS	Participants were randomized to 2 sequences of fasted and fed ( or vice versa ) administration of one 150/1 ,000 mg canagliflozin/metformin IR FDC , with 10-14 day washout between treatments PK parameters ( AUC , Cmax , tmax , t1/2 ) were assessed for canagliflozin and metformin . METHODS	Safety was evaluated . RESULTS	When comparing the IR FDC tablet administered with and without food , PK parameters of canagliflozin were bioequivalent as the 90 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for log-transformed AUClast , AUC , and Cmax were within the bioequivalence limits of 80-125 % . RESULTS	For metformin , overall exposure was similar under fed and fasted conditions as geometric mean ratios for AUC and associated 90 % CI were contained within the bioequivalence limits , but geometric mean Cmax decreased by 16 % in the fed compared to fasted state . RESULTS	Both treatments were well tolerated with similar adverse events and most common were gastrointestinal events , generally attributed to metformin . CONCLUSIONS	Food did not affect canagliflozin bioavailability parameters ( Cmax and AUCs ) or AUCs of metformin . CONCLUSIONS	The Cmax of metformin was decreased by 16 % , which is not considered clinically meaningful . CONCLUSIONS	The canagliflozin/metformin FDC tablet is recommended to be taken with meals to reduce the symptoms of gastrointestinal intolerability associated with metformin ."
"BACKGROUND	Nilotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL1/BCR-ABL 1 and KIT , platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( PDGFRs ) , and the discoidin domain receptor . BACKGROUND	Gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFR are key drivers in most gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( GISTs ) . BACKGROUND	This trial was designed to test the efficacy and safety of nilotinib versus imatinib as first-line therapy for patients with advanced GISTs . METHODS	In this randomised , open-label , multicentre , phase 3 trial ( ENESTg1 ) , participants from academic centres were aged 18 years or older and had previously untreated , histologically confirmed , metastatic or unresectable GISTs . METHODS	Patients were stratified by previous adjuvant therapy and randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) via a randomisation list to receive oral imatinib 400 mg once daily or oral nilotinib 400 mg twice daily . METHODS	The primary endpoint was centrally reviewed progression-free survival . METHODS	Efficacy endpoints were assessed by intention-to-treat . METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00785785 . RESULTS	Because the futility boundary was crossed at a preplanned interim analysis , trial accrual terminated in April , 2011 . RESULTS	Between March 16 , 2009 , and April 21 , 2011 , 647 patients were enrolled ; of whom 324 were allocated nilotinib and 320 were allocated imatinib . RESULTS	At final analysis of the core study ( data cutoff , October , 2012 ) , 2-year progression-free survival was higher in the imatinib group ( 592 % [ 95 % CI 509-665 ] ) than in the nilotinib group ( 516 % [ 430-595 ] ; hazard ratio 147 [ 95 % CI 110-195 ] ) . RESULTS	In the imatinib group , the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypophosphataemia ( 19 [ 6 % ] ) , anaemia ( 17 [ 5 % ] ) , abdominal pain ( 13 ; 4 % ) , and elevated lipase level ( 15 ; 5 % ) , and in the nilotinib group were anaemia ( 18 ; 6 % ) , elevated lipase level ( 15 ; 5 % ) , elevated alanine aminotransferase concentration ( 12 ; 4 % ) , and abdominal pain ( 11 ; 3 % ) . RESULTS	The most common serious adverse event in both groups was abdominal pain ( 11 [ 4 % ] in the imatinib group , 14 [ 4 % ] in the nilotinib group ) . CONCLUSIONS	Nilotinib can not be recommended for broad use to treat first-line GIST . CONCLUSIONS	However , future studies might identify patient subsets for whom first-line nilotinib could be of clinical benefit . BACKGROUND	Novartis Pharmaceuticals ."
"BACKGROUND	Alterations in serotonergic ( 5-HT ) metabolism and/or intestinal integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT , 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ) , on mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity , and to assess potential differences between healthy controls and IBS patients . METHODS	Fifteen IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study . METHODS	Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo . METHODS	Mucosal serotonergic metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples . RESULTS	5-HTP administration significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA , the main metabolite of 5-HT , in both healthy controls ( 7.1 1.7 vs. 2.5 0.7 pmol/mg , 5-HTP vs. placebo , P = 0.02 ) and IBS patients ( 20.0 4.8 vs. 8.1 1.3 pmol/mg , 5-HTP vs. placebo , P = 0.02 ) , with the latter group showing a significantly larger increase . RESULTS	Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after administration of 5-HTP ( P < 0.05 ) in healthy controls and were accompanied by redistribution of zonula occludens-1 ( ZO-1 ) , pointing to reinforcement of the barrier . RESULTS	In IBS , expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly lower compared to healthy controls , and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in occludin expression . CONCLUSIONS	Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT metabolism . CONCLUSIONS	In healthy controls , a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients . CONCLUSIONS	This could indicate the presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier function , which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients ."
"BACKGROUND	A wireless motility capsule is a new method for ambulatory assessment of transit times and motility throughout the gastrointestinal tract . BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of a wireless motility capsule to detect drug effects on gastric emptying time ( GET ) and gastric contractility . METHODS	15 healthy adults were administered in random order saline , erythromycin IV 150 mg , or morphine IV 0.05 mg/kg BW . METHODS	Subjects ate a standard meal after each infusion , and subsequently ingested the motility capsule . METHODS	Data were recorded for 8 hours , and the results were analyzed using the manufacturer 's software . RESULTS	GET was significantly faster after erythromycin than either saline or morphine . RESULTS	Morphine tended to delay emptying of the capsule compared to saline . RESULTS	There was a trend toward a greater frequency of gastric contractions with erythromycin and a reduced frequency of gastric contractions with morphine that did not reach statistical significance . CONCLUSIONS	A wireless motility capsule successfully detected acceleration of gastric emptying induced by erythromycin , and retardation of gastric motility caused by morphine . CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate that a wireless motility capsule is a promising technique to assess pharmacologic effects on gastric transit and contractility and aid in development of drugs for gastric motor disorders ."
"METHODS	Urolithins are bioactive metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from ellagitannins ( ETs ) and ellagic acid ( EA ) . METHODS	We investigated whether urolithins could be detected in colon tissues from colorectal cancer ( CRC ) patients after pomegranate extract ( PE ) intake . RESULTS	CRC patients ( n = 52 ) were divided into controls and PEs consumers ( 900 mg/day for 15 days ) before surgical resection . RESULTS	PEs with low ( PE-1 ) and high ( PE-2 ) punicalagin : EA ratio were administered . RESULTS	Twenty-three metabolites , but no ellagitannins , were detected in urine , plasma , normal ( NT ) or malignant ( MT ) colon tissues using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS / MS ( UPLC , ultra performance liquid chromatography ; QTOF , quadrupole TOF ) . RESULTS	Free EA , five EA conjugates , gallic acid and 12 urolithin derivatives were found in colon tissues . RESULTS	Individual and total metabolites levels were higher in NT than in MT , independently of the PE consumed . RESULTS	The maximal mean concentration ( 1671 367 ng/g ) was found in NT after consumption of PE-1 and the lowest concentration ( 42.4 10.2 ng/g ) in MT with PE-2 . RESULTS	Urolithin A or isourolithin A were the main urolithins produced ( 54 and 46 % patients with urolithin A or isourolithin A phenotype , respectively ) . RESULTS	High punicalagin content ( PE-2 ) hampered urolithins formation . CONCLUSIONS	Significant levels of EA derivatives and urolithins are found in human colon tissues from CRC patients after consumption of pomegranate . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted to elucidate their biological activity ."
"OBJECTIVE	Sodium drink is used as a countermeasure against body fluid loss . OBJECTIVE	However , high concentrations of sodium may cause gastrointestinal upset ( e.g. , diarrhea ) . OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine the sodium concentration that induces hypervolemia with a minimal risk of gastrointestinal disturbance . METHODS	Eight healthy active males rested in a chair and ingested a given amount ( 16-17 ml kg body mass ( -1 ) ) of water ( W ) or solution containing 60 , 120 or 180 mmol l ( -1 ) Na ( + ) ( 60 , 120 and 180Na trials ) in 6 equal portions at 10 min intervals . METHODS	To standardize their hydration status , subjects consumed the same meal and water 2 h before each trial . METHODS	Drink trials were performed on separate days , and the order was randomized . METHODS	The change in plasma volume ( PV ) from pre-drink status was estimated from the hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit every 30 min for 150 min after initiation of drinking . RESULTS	Subjects began trials in a euhydrated state , as reflected by their plasma osmolality ( in mmol l ( -1 ) : W , 289.4 1.4 ; 60Na , 287.0 3.5 ; 120Na , 287.6 2.3 ; 180Na , 288.9 3.3 ) . RESULTS	At 120 min , PV had not increased from the pre-drink value in the W ( -0.8 4.5 % ) or 60Na ( 2.4 4.9 % ) trials , but it increased to similar degrees in the 120Na ( 7.2 4.6 % ) and 180Na ( 9.4 6.6 % ) trials . RESULTS	No diarrhea was reported in the W or 60Na trials , but it was reported in the 120Na ( n = 1 ) and 180Na ( n = 6 ) trials . CONCLUSIONS	Beverages containing 120 mmol l ( -1 ) Na ( + ) induce hypervolemia with a minimum incidence of gastrointestinal problems ."
"BACKGROUND	Probiotics may help resolve bowel symptoms and improve quality of life . BACKGROUND	We investigated the effects of 12 weeks of probiotics administration in colorectal cancer patients . METHODS	We conducted a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial . METHODS	The participants took probiotics ( Lacidofil ) or placebo twice a day for 12 weeks . METHODS	The cancer-related quality of life ( FACT ) , patient 's health-9 ( PHQ-9 ) , and bowel symptom questionnaires were completed by each participant . RESULTS	We obtained data for 32 participants in the placebo group and 28 participants in the probiotics group . RESULTS	The mean ages of total participants were 56.18 .86 years and 58.3 % were male . RESULTS	Administration of probiotics significantly decreased the proportion of patients suffering from irritable bowel symptoms ( 0 week vs. 12 week ; 67.9 % vs. 45.7 % , p = 0.03 ) , improved colorectal cancer-related FACT ( baseline vs. 12 weeks : 19.79 4.66 vs. 21.18 3.67 , p = 0.04 ) and fatigue-related FACT ( baseline vs. 12 weeks : 43.00 ( 36.50-45 .50 ) vs. 44.50 ( 38.50-49 .00 ) , p = 0.02 ) and PHQ-9 scores ( 0 weeks vs. 12 weeks ; 3.00 ( 0-8 .00 ) vs. 1.00 ( 0-3 .00 ) , p = 0.01 ) . RESULTS	We found significant differences in changes of the proportion of patients with bowel symptoms ( p < 0.05 ) , functional well-being scores ( p = 0.04 ) and cancer-related FACT scores ( p = 0.04 ) between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS	Probiotics improved bowel symptoms and quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors ."
"BACKGROUND	Patients with Addison 's disease ( AD ) report impaired subjective health status ( SHS ) . BACKGROUND	Since cortisol exhibits a robust circadian cycle that entrains other biological clocks , impaired SHS may be due to the noncircadian cortisol profile achieved with conventional glucocorticoid replacement . BACKGROUND	Continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion ( CSHI ) reproduces a circadian cortisol profile , but its effects on SHS have not been objectively evaluated . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of CSHI on SHS in AD . METHODS	This was a multicentre , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of CSHI vs oral glucocorticoid therapy . METHODS	Participants received in random order 4 weeks of : CSHI and oral placebo , and subcutaneous placebo and oral hydrocortisone , separated by a 2-week washout period . METHODS	SHS was assessed using the Short-Form 36 ( SF-36 ) , General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ-28 ) , Fatigue Scale ( FS ) , Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) ; and Addison 's Quality of Life Questionnaire ( AddiQoL ) . METHODS	Participants were asked their ( blinded ) treatment preference . METHODS	Twenty-four hour urine free cortisol ( UFC ) and diurnal salivary cortisol collections compared cortisol exposure during each treatment . RESULTS	Ten participants completed the study . RESULTS	Baseline SHS scores ( mean SE ) were consistent with mild impairment : SF-36 physical component summary 48.4 ( 2.4 ) , mental component summary 53.3 ( 3.0 ) ; GHQ-28 18.1 ( 3.3 ) ; GSRS 3.7 ( 1.6 ) , and AddiQoL 94.7 ( 3.7 ) . RESULTS	FS was similar to other AD cohorts 13.5 ( 1.0 ) ( P = 0.82 ) . RESULTS	UFC between treatments was not different ( P = 0.87 ) . RESULTS	The salivary cortisol at 0800 h was higher during CSHI ( P = 0.03 ) , but not at any other time points measured . RESULTS	There was no difference between the treatments in the SHS assessments . RESULTS	Five participants preferred CSHI , four oral hydrocortisone , and one was uncertain . CONCLUSIONS	Biochemical measurements indicate similar cortisol exposure during each treatment period , although a more circadian pattern was evident during CSHI . CONCLUSIONS	CSHI does not improve SHS in AD with good baseline SHS . CONCLUSIONS	This casts some doubt on the potential benefit of circadian cortisol delivery on SHS in AD ."
"OBJECTIVE	This study aims to identify the optimal mini-invasive treatment for extrahepatic bile duct stones . METHODS	One hundred and seventy eight patients with EHBD stones were randomized into 4 groups : laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration ( LCBDE ) plus T-tube drainage ( group LT ) , LC and LCBDE with endonasobiliary drainage ( ENBD ) tube ( group LE ) , and endoscopic sphincterotomy with ENBD followed by LC ( group EE ) and T-tube drainage of open CBDE ( group OT ) . METHODS	Demographic data , perioperative findings , postoperative outcomes , hospital expense , gastrointestinal quality of life index ( GIQLI ) scores and cost per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) were analyzed . RESULTS	The operating time was longest in group EE . RESULTS	There was less bleeding in group OT and EE . RESULTS	Group LE and EE had shorter hospital stay and recovery time of intestinal motility . RESULTS	The postoperative white blood cell count and serum C-reaction protein level were higher in group LT and OT . RESULTS	Postoperatively , the mean GIQLI scores in group LE and EE were higher . RESULTS	Mean cost were highest in group EE . RESULTS	Patients in group LE had lowest cost per QALY . CONCLUSIONS	The modified laparoscopic procedure , LC combined with LCBDE followed by a primary closure over the ENBD tubes , appears to be the best option for patients with EHBD stones ."
"BACKGROUND	Disrupting the physical structure of pulses by blending them or by using a digestive supplement ( - galactosidase ) to reduce intestinal discomfort could potentially negate the previously observed beneficial effects of whole pulses of lowering appetitive and glycemic responses because of more rapid digestion . OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that blended lentils , - galactosidase , or both increase postprandial appetite and blood glucose responses vs. whole lentils . METHODS	Men and women [ n = 12 ; means SDs body mass index ( kg/m ( 2 ) ) : 23.3 3.1 ; aged 28 10 y ] consumed breakfast meals containing whole ( W ) , blended ( B ) , or no lentils [ control ( C ) ] , each with 3 - galactosidase or placebo capsules in a randomized , crossover , double-blind placebo-controlled trial . METHODS	Between each test day there was a 3 - to 5-d washout period . RESULTS	Mixed-model ANOVA showed effects of meal on postprandial appetite and glucose ( P = 0.0001-0 .031 ) . RESULTS	The B meal resulted in higher postprandial appetite ratings than did the W meal but not the C meal for hunger , desire to eat , and prospective consumption ( = 0.4-0 .5 points ; P = 0.002-0 .044 ) . RESULTS	Postprandial glucose concentration was 4.5 mg/dL lower for the B meal than for the C meal ( P < 0.0001 ) but did not differ from the W meal . RESULTS	There were no main effects of - galactosidase , but there were meal - galactosidase interaction effects , with a greater postprandial desire to eat and lower postprandial fullness with the B meal than with the 2 other meals in the placebo condition but not in the - galactosidase condition . CONCLUSIONS	Blending lentils increased appetite ( 6 % ) , but not glycemic response , compared with whole lentils , whereas - galactosidase did not . CONCLUSIONS	Both B and W meals may be consumed ( with or without an - galactosidase supplement ) with little impact on appetite , without increasing glycemic response . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02110511 ."
"BACKGROUND	Activation of the ileal brake , by infusing lipid directly into the distal part of the small intestine , alters gastrointestinal ( GI ) motility and inhibits food intake . BACKGROUND	The ileal brake effect on eating behavior of the other macronutrients is currently unknown . OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of ileal infusion of sucrose and casein on food intake , release of GI peptides , gastric emptying rate and small-bowel transit time with safflower oil as positive control . METHODS	This randomized , single-blind , crossover study was performed in 13 healthy subjects ( 6 male ; mean age 26.42.9 years ; mean body mass index 22.80.4 kgm ( -2 ) ) who were intubated with a naso-ileal catheter . METHODS	Thirty minutes after the intake of a standardized breakfast , participants received an ileal infusion , containing control ( ( C ) saline ) , safflower oil ( ( HL ) 51.7 kcal ) , low-dose casein ( ( LP ) 17.2 kcal ) or high-dose casein ( ( HP ) 51.7 kcal ) , low-dose sucrose ( ( LC ) 17.2 kcal ) and high-dose sucrose ( ( HC ) 51.7 kcal ) , over a period of 90min . METHODS	Food intake was determined during an ad libitum meal . METHODS	Visual analogue score questionnaires for hunger and satiety and blood samples were collected at regular intervals . RESULTS	Ileal infusion of lipid , protein and carbohydrate resulted in a significant reduction in food intake compared with control ( HL : 464.390.7 kcal , P < 0.001 ; HP : 458.078.6 kcal , P < 0.005 ; HC : 399.057.0 kcal , P < 0.0001 vs control : 586.770.2 kcal , P < 0.001 , respectively ) . RESULTS	A reduction in energy intake was still apparent when the caloric amount of infused nutrients was added to the amount eaten during the ad libitum meal.Secretion of cholecystokinin and peptide YY but not of glucagon-like peptide-1 ( 7-36 ) was increased during ileal perfusion of fat , carbohydrates and protein . RESULTS	During ileal perfusion of all macronutrients , a delay in gastric emptying and intestinal transit was observed , but differences were not significant compared with control . CONCLUSIONS	Apart from lipids , also sucrose and casein reduce food intake on ileal infusion , thereby activating the ileal brake . CONCLUSIONS	In addition to food intake , also satiety and GI peptide secretion were affected ."
"OBJECTIVE	A step stool is an ordinary device to improve the quality of chest compression ( CC ) during in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . OBJECTIVE	We investigated the effect of an inclined step stool on the quality of CC during CPR on a hospital bed . METHODS	We conducted a randomized crossover study of simulation using a manikin . METHODS	Two different methods of CC were performed and compared : CC using a flat stool and CC using an inclined ( 20 ) stool . METHODS	Each session of CC was performed for 2 minutes using a metronome at a rate of 110 beats per minute . METHODS	The primary outcome was the depth of CC . METHODS	The adequate CC rate , duty cycle , rate of incomplete recoil , and the angle between the arm of the participants and the bed were also measured . RESULTS	The median value of the mean depth of CC was 50.5 mm ( 45.0-57 .0 mm ) in the flat stool group and 54.5 mm ( 47.0-58 .3 mm ) in the inclined stool group ( P = .014 ) . RESULTS	The adequate CC rate was significantly higher in the inclined stool group ( 84.2 % [ 37.6 % -99.1 % ] vs 57.0 % [ 15.2 % -95.0 % ] ; P = .016 ) . RESULTS	The duty cycle and the rate of incomplete recoil were comparable between the 2 groups . RESULTS	The angles between the arm of the participants and the bed were more vertical in the inclined stool group ( 84.0 5.2 vs 81.0 4.8 ; P = .014 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Using an inclined stool resulted in an improvement in the depth of CC and the adequate CC rate without increasing the rate of incomplete chest recoil ."
"OBJECTIVE	A distinct suppressive effect of a whey protein ( including glycomacropeptide ) - enriched preload drink on subsequent food intake in comparison with a maltodextrin carbohydrate-enriched preload was demonstrated in an earlier companion study with the same female subjects ; however , the potential mediators underlying the effect are unclear . OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate how the ingestion of a whey protein-enriched preload beverage affected postprandial plasma concentrations of several satiety-related gastrointestinal hormones and metabolites in comparison with a maltodextrin carbohydrate-enriched preload . METHODS	Eighteen normal-weight women were studied in a single-blind , randomized block design . METHODS	Blood samples were collected at various time intervals for 120min after consumption of a test drink ( 300ml , ~ 1300kJ ) enriched ( 45g ) with either maltodextrin carbohydrate or whey protein containing naturally present glycomacropeptide . RESULTS	Plasma-active ghrelin concentrations decreased after both maltodextrin carbohydrate - and whey protein-enriched test drinks ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The whey protein-enriched beverage led to increased plasma concentrations of cholecystokinin ( CCK ) at 60 and 75min ( P < 0.05 ) , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) at 90min ( P < 0.001 ) , peptide tyrosine-tyrosine ( PYY ) at 90 and 120min ( P < 0.01 ) and pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) from 15 to 120min ( P < 0.05 ) compared with maltodextrin carbohydrate . RESULTS	Total amino acid , urea and ammonia plasma concentrations were also higher after whey protein compared with maltodextrin carbohydrate ingestion ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Increased plasma concentrations of some gastrointestinal hormones related to satiety , particularly PP , and of amino acids and their metabolites , may have acted either singly or together to mediate the observed satiety response to whey protein ."
"OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of rhubarb combined with early enteral nutrition ( EEN ) on the gastrointestinal function , disease severity and systemic inflammation in patients with severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) . METHODS	A total of 126 patients with SAP were randomly assigned into three groups : parenteral nutrition group , treated with standard solution first and EN 14 days later ; EEN group , treated with EN suspension ; or EEN combined with rhubarb group , treated with rhubarb and then EN 2 h later . METHODS	The gastrointestinal function , APACHE II scores , the levels of plasma IL-6 , IL-11 , C-reactive proteins ( CRP ) and the liver and kidney functional measures were longitudinally analyzed . RESULTS	Patients in the EEN/rhubarb group had the shortest period of abdominal pain and the fastest recovery from abnormal bowel movement and high fever as well as significantly shorter periods of intensive-care unit and hospital stays . RESULTS	The combination of EEN and rhubarb significantly reduced the values of APACHE II scores . RESULTS	Combination therapies significantly reduced abnormally higher white blood cell ( WBC ) counts and levels of plasma CRP and IL-6 , but increased the levels of plasma IL-11 . RESULTS	Finally , combination therapies improved the SAP-related damages of liver and kidney function by reducing abnormally higher levels of plasma alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , and creatinine ( Cr ) . CONCLUSIONS	Combination of EEN and rhubarb significantly improved the gastrointestinal function , inhibited systemic inflammation and disease severity and mitigated the disease-related damages of liver and kidney function in SAP patients ."
"OBJECTIVE	To determine whether premature infants ' sleep organization , total sleep time , and arousals may be modulated while on a conformational positioner that provides boundaries , customized positioning , and containment compared with standard positioning ( standard crib mattress ) . METHODS	A proof of concept trial using a within subject crossover design was conducted among 25 premature infants with feeding difficulties . METHODS	Infants of 31.5 weeks gestational age served as their own control during overnight polysomnography at postconceptual age 38.4 weeks . METHODS	Each baby received both interventions ( order randomized ) , 1 for each one-half of the 10.5-hour study . RESULTS	Use of the conformational positioner resulted in higher sleep efficiency of 61 % vs 54 % for the standard mattress ( P < .05 ) . RESULTS	The interventions did not differ for percent active sleep , percent quiet sleep , percent indeterminate sleep , or spontaneous arousals . RESULTS	Sleep efficiency was higher on the conformational positioner than standard positioning for surgical subjects and for subjects with necrotizing enterocolitis or gastroschisis ( n = 10 ) . RESULTS	The surgical subjects ( n = 9 ) had lower sleep efficiency , lower percentage of active sleep , and more spontaneous arousals compared with the nonsurgical group . CONCLUSIONS	The use of the conformational positioner improved sleep efficiency vs the standard mattress in premature infants with feeding difficulties . CONCLUSIONS	Infants requiring surgery or with gastrointestinal diagnoses may be more susceptible to environmental stress ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the dose-ranging efficacy and safety of LX4211 , a dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter ( SGLT ) 1 and SGLT2 , in type 2 diabetes . METHODS	Type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled on metformin were randomly assigned to 75 mg once daily , 200 mg once daily , 200 mg twice daily , or 400 mg once daily of LX4211 or placebo . METHODS	Primary end point was A1C change from baseline to week 12 . METHODS	Secondary end points included changes in blood pressure ( BP ) and body weight . RESULTS	Baseline characteristics in 299 patients randomly assigned to LX4211 or placebo in this 12-week dose-ranging study were similar : mean age 55.9 years , A1C 8.1 % ( 65 mmol/mol ) , BMI 33.1 kg/m ( 2 ) , and BP 124/79 mmHg . RESULTS	LX4211 significantly reduced A1C to week 12 in a dose-dependent manner by 0.42 % ( 4.6 mmol/mol ) , 0.52 % ( 5.7 mmol/mol ) , 0.80 % ( 8.7 mmol/mol ) , and 0.92 % ( 10.0 mmol/mol ) , respectively ( P < 0.001 each ) , compared with 0.09 % ( 1.0 mmol/mol ) for placebo . RESULTS	Greater A1C reductions were produced by 400 mg once a day than 200 mg once a day LX4211 without higher urinary glucose excretion , suggesting a contribution of SGLT1 inhibition . RESULTS	Significant reductions were seen in body weight ( -1.85 kg ; P < 0.001 ) and systolic BP ( -5.7 mmHg ; P < 0.001 ) , but diastolic BP was unchanged ( -1.6 ; P = 0.164 ) . RESULTS	Adverse events with LX4211 were mild to moderate and similar to placebo , including urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal-related events ; genital infections were limited to LX4211 groups ( 0-5 .0 % ) . RESULTS	No hypoglycemia occurred . CONCLUSIONS	Dual inhibition of SGLT1/SGLT2 with LX4211 produced significant dose-ranging improvements in glucose control without dose-increasing glucosuria and was associated with reductions in weight and systolic BP in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes ."
"BACKGROUND	Blood donation is known to contribute to iron deficiency in regular blood donors . BACKGROUND	This study investigated the safety and efficacy of postdonation iron replacement to mitigate iron deficiency in blood donors . METHODS	A total of 282 female whole blood donors aged 18 to 45 were prospectively randomized in a double-blinded placebo controlled trial to receive an 8-week postdonation course of carbonyl iron ( 45mg daily ) or placebo . METHODS	The primary endpoint was prevalence of iron deficiency ( ferritin < 15ng/mL ) at 12 weeks postdonation . METHODS	Secondary endpoints were eligibility to donate based on capillary hemoglobin ( Hb ) and incidence of gastrointestinal ( GI ) complaints . RESULTS	Ferritin levels at Week 12 were significantly higher in donors receiving carbonyl iron ( 17.010.9 ng/mL ) compared with those receiving placebo ( 10.68.4 ng/mL ; p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The proportion of iron-deficient donors was significantly lower in the carbonyl iron group ( 51.9 % ) compared to the placebo ( 80.5 % ; p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The mean Hb level in the carbonyl iron group ( 134.68.7 g/L ) was significantly higher than in the placebo arm ( 130.09.9 g/L ; p < 0.001 ) , significantly improving eligibility to donate at Week 12 . RESULTS	Significantly more donors receiving carbonyl iron had at least one GI side effect ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Importantly , 86.7 % of donors receiving carbonyl iron indicated that they would take iron on an ongoing basis . CONCLUSIONS	An 8-week postdonation course of 45mg of carbonyl iron significantly reduced iron deficiency and was well tolerated in female whole blood donors . CONCLUSIONS	Postdonation iron replacement may have a role in a broader strategy to optimize donor iron status ."
"BACKGROUND	A ` fast-track protocol ' in surgery suggests the application of evidence-based practices to expedite patient recovery . BACKGROUND	It has shown to reduce hospital stay , hasten recovery as well as facilitate earlier return to work . BACKGROUND	It has a considerable impact in reducing healthcare costs . BACKGROUND	The basic tenet is to treat the patient 's disease by minimal disturbance of their physiology . BACKGROUND	The protocol encompasses pre-operative , intra-operative and post-operative interventions which when carried out together would show maximal benefits . BACKGROUND	The surgeon is usually the leader of the team managing the patient , but it can not be over-emphasised that this is a multi-disciplinary team approach . METHODS	We conducted a prospective interventional study to investigate whether ` fast-track ' surgery protocols improve patient outcome when compared to traditional peri-operative care followed at our institute . METHODS	By doing so , we observed that the patients who underwent ` fast tracking ' required lesser analgesia , had earlier ambulation , earlier return of intestinal motility , were free from tubes , catheters and drains earlier and lastly were discharged earlier . METHODS	This was achieved without a rise in complications or re-admissions . CONCLUSIONS	The results have proved that implementing the fast-track protocol for gastrointestinal surgeries is not only safe and effective , but also improves patient outcome ."
"BACKGROUND	Posterior rectal dissection during ileal pouch-anal anastomosis ( IPAA ) can be performed in the total mesorectal excision ( TME ) or close rectal dissection ( CRD ) plane . BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare morbidity and quality of life ( QoL ) in patients having TME or CRD during proctectomy followed by IPAA for benign disease . METHODS	In this randomized clinical trial , patients undergoing IPAA were allocated to TME or CRD . METHODS	Thirty-day morbidity was determined and QoL assessed using Short Form 36 , GIQLI ( GastroIntestinal Quality of Life Index ) and COREFO ( COloREctal Functional Outcome ) questionnaires . METHODS	The primary outcome ( pouch compliance ) of the trial is to be reported separately . RESULTS	Fifty-nine patients were included , 28 in the CRD and 31 in the TME group . RESULTS	Baseline data were similar , except for more previous abdominal surgery in the TME group . RESULTS	Operating time was longer for patients having CRD ( 195min versus 166min for TME ; P = 0008 ) . RESULTS	More patients in the TME group had a primary defunctioning ileostomy ( 7 of 31 versus 1 of 28 for CRD ; P = 0055 ) . RESULTS	Severe complications occurred more frequently in the TME group ( 10 of 31 versus 2 of 28 for CRD ) . RESULTS	QoL was better in the CRD group for several subscales of the questionnaires measured at 1 , 3 and 6 months after surgery . RESULTS	At 12 months , QoL was similar in the two groups for all subscales . CONCLUSIONS	CRD led to a lower severe complication rate and better short-term QoL than wide TME ."

"BACKGROUND	Early enteral fat supplementation and fish oil ( FO ) stimulates post-resection intestinal adaptation in rats and increases fat absorption in premature infants with bowel resection and an enterostomy . OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that early fat supplement and FO increases post-resection protein absorption , intestinal RNA , protein without decreasing intestinal arachidonic acid ( AA ) in premature infants with an enterostomy . METHODS	36 premature infants ( < 2 months old ) with an enterostomy after surgical treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation who tolerated enteral feeding at 20 ml/kg/day were randomized to usual care ( control , n = 18 ) or early supplementing enteral Microlipid ( ML ) and FO ( treatment , n = 18 ) . METHODS	Intralipid was decreased as the dose of enteral fat was increased . METHODS	Daily weight , ostomy output and nutritional intake were recorded . METHODS	Weekly 24-hour ostomy effluent was collected to measure fecal protein . METHODS	Protein absorption was calculated by subtracting fecal protein from dietary protein . METHODS	Tissue samples from the functional stoma and the nonfunctional distal diverted end were collected during bowel reanastomosis to measure RNA , protein , and fatty acid ( FA ) profile . RESULTS	Compared to controls , the treatment group had higher protein absorption ( g/kg/day ) and intestinal RNA and protein ( g/mg tissue ) proximal to the ostomy . RESULTS	The two groups had similar FA profiles except that the treatment group had higher n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA , g/mg tissue ) proximal to the ostomy . CONCLUSIONS	Early supplementation of enteral ML and FO to premature infants with an enterostomy increased dietary protein absorption , intestinal RNA , protein and n-3 EPA content without altering other FA content ."
"BACKGROUND	Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) is a common chronic enteropathy in dogs . BACKGROUND	There are no published studies regarding the use of probiotics in the treatment of canine IBD . BACKGROUND	The objectives were to compare responses to treatment with either combination therapy ( prednisone and metronidazole ) or probiotic strains ( VSL # 3 ) in dogs with IBD . RESULTS	Twenty pet dogs with a diagnosis of IBD , ten healthy pet dogs , and archived control intestinal tissues from three euthanized dogs were used in this open label study . RESULTS	Dogs with IBD were randomized to receive either probiotic ( D-VSL # 3 , n = 10 ) or combination drug therapy ( D-CT , n = 10 ) . RESULTS	Dogs were monitored for 60 days ( during treatment ) and re-evaluated 30 days after completing treatment . RESULTS	The CIBDAI ( P < 0.001 ) , duodenal histology scores ( P < 0.001 ) , and CD3 + cells decreased post-treatment in both treatment groups . RESULTS	FoxP3 + cells ( p < 0.002 ) increased in the D-VSL # 3 group after treatment but not in the D-CT group . RESULTS	TGF - + cells increased in both groups after treatment ( P = 0.0043 ) with the magnitude of this increase being significantly greater for dogs in the D-VSL # 3 group compared to the D-CT group . RESULTS	Changes in apical junction complex molecules occludin and claudin-2 differed depending on treatment . RESULTS	Faecalibacterium and Turicibacter were significantly decreased in dogs with IBD at T0 , with a significant increase in Faecalibacterium abundance observed in the animals treated with VSL # 3 strains . CONCLUSIONS	A protective effect of VSL # 3 strains was observed in dogs with IBD , with a significant decrease in clinical and histological scores and a decrease in CD3 + T-cell infiltration . CONCLUSIONS	Protection was associated with an enhancement of regulatory T-cell markers ( FoxP3 + and TGF - + ) , specifically observed in the probiotic-treated group and not in animals receiving combination therapy . CONCLUSIONS	A normalization of dysbiosis after long-term therapy was observed in the probiotic group . CONCLUSIONS	Larger scale studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of VSL # 3 in canine IBD ."
"BACKGROUND	No validated patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) measure exists for functional dyspepsia ( FD ) assessment . BACKGROUND	Verbal descriptions of different upper abdominal symptoms may be poorly distinguishable to patients . OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether understanding of FD symptoms is enhanced by pictograms symbolising the nature of the symptoms , besides verbal descriptors . METHODS	Consecutive FD patients were randomised to fill out a questionnaire assessing nineupper gastrointestinal symptoms ( post-prandial fullness , early satiation , epigastric pain , epigastric burning , bloating centred in the upper abdomen , nausea , vomiting , heartburn , regurgitation ) with or without accompanying pictograms . METHODS	Symptoms were rated for frequency and severity ( 0-5 ) , and patients also identified the most bothersome symptom . METHODS	Subsequently , in-depth history was taken by an expert clinician , who filled out the same symptom ratings . METHODS	Concordance between patient and clinician ratings was quantified using chi-square and kappa statistics . RESULTS	Content validity of pictograms was first confirmed by 15 FD patients . RESULTS	Next , 76 patients ( 52 women , age 42.21.9 ) were randomised to questionnaires with or without pictograms . RESULTS	The concordance with clinician 's assessment as gold standard rose from 36 without to 48 % for questions with pictograms ( P < 0.0001 ) . RESULTS	Considering the Rome III subdivision , benefit in concordance with pictograms was present for post-prandial distress , epigastric pain syndrome and reflux symptoms . RESULTS	Kappa statistics confirmed these gains ( weighted kappa values for concordance of symptom frequency ratings rose from 0.214 to 0.446 with pictograms ) , and also showed better concordance of the most bothersome symptom with pictograms . CONCLUSIONS	Pictograms accompanying verbal descriptors significantly improve concordance of functional dyspepsia symptom ratings by patients with evaluation by their physicians ."
"BACKGROUND	As new members of a drug class are developed , head-to-head trials are an important strategy to guide personalised treatment decisions . BACKGROUND	We assessed two glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists , once-weekly albiglutide and once-daily liraglutide , in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs . METHODS	We undertook this 32-week , open-label , phase 3 non-inferiority study at 162 sites in eight countries : USA ( 121 sites ) , Australia ( 9 sites ) , Peru ( 7 sites ) , Philippines ( 7 sites ) , South Korea ( 5 sites ) , UK ( 5 sites ) , Israel ( 4 sites ) , and Spain ( 4 sites ) . METHODS	841 adult participants ( aged 18 years ) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and a BMI between 20 and 45 kg/m ( 2 ) were enrolled and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive albiglutide 30 mg once weekly titrated to 50 mg at week 6 , or liraglutide 06 mg once daily titrated to 12 mg at week 1 and 18 mg at week 2 . METHODS	The randomisation schedule was generated by an independent randomisation team by the permuted block method with a fixed block size of 16 .

CONCLUSIONS	Patients who received once-daily liraglutide had greater reductions in HbA1c than did those who received once-weekly albiglutide . CONCLUSIONS	Participants in the albiglutide group had more injection-site reactions and fewer gastrointestinal events than did those in the liraglutide group . BACKGROUND	GlaxoSmithKline ."
"OBJECTIVE	Gastroscopy and gastroscopic mucosal biopsy techniques have become increasingly used as of late for evaluating symptoms presumed to be originated in the upper gastrointestinal tract . OBJECTIVE	Patients often complain however of abdominal pain post-gastroscopic mucosal biopsy , and this study aimed to explore the necessity of acid inhibitors when abdominal pain worsened . METHODS	In this randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study , we screened 272 participants , and ultimately enrolled 200 into the study . METHODS	These 200 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive acid inhibitors ( esomeprazole , treatment group , n = 100 ; dose ,20 mg/d ) or matched placebo ( control group , n = 100 ) for 3 days post-gastroscopic mucosal biopsy . METHODS	The presence of abdominal pain was observed pre-and post-gastroscopy , and the therapeutic effect of esomeprazole was assessed . METHODS	This study was registered at the Chinese clinical trial registry as ChiCTR-TRC-00000500 . RESULTS	Ten subjects were lost to followup ( 4 in treatment group ; 6 in the control group ) . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the number of subjects with aggravating abdominal pain ( treatment 29.2 % vs. control 22.3 % ; p > 0.05 ) between the two groups . RESULTS	Esomeprazole did not significantly ( p > 0.05 ) affect the rate of abdominal pain within 24 h ( treatment 27.1 % vs. control 19.1 % ) , 48 h ( treatment 40.6 % vs. control 27.7 % ) , and 96 h ( treatment 43.8 % vs. control 34.0 % ) on abdominal pain in all in the evaluated subjects . RESULTS	Between the two groups however , a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) was found on overall effective treatment rates at 48 h ( treatment 92.9 % vs. control 66.7 % ) and at 96 h ( treatment 100 % vs. control 81 % ) in the subjects with worsened abdominal pain . CONCLUSIONS	The study suggests that routine prophylaxis with acid inhibitors is not recommended for all patients post-gastroscopic mucosal biopsy , however acid inhibitors should be administered for patients with aggravating abdominal pain ."
"BACKGROUND	Steroids may improve outcomes in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass ( CBP ) . BACKGROUND	There is a need \ for a large randomized controlled trial to clarify the effect of steroids in such patients . METHODS	We plan to randomize 7,500 patients with elevated European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation who are undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of CBP to methylprednisolone or placebo . METHODS	The first coprimary outcome is 30-day all-cause mortality , and the most second coprimary outcome is a composite of death , MI , stroke , renal failure , or respiratory failure within 30 days . METHODS	Other outcomes include a composite of MI or mortality at 30 days , new onset atrial fibrillation , bleeding and transfusion requirements , length of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay , infection , stroke , wound complications , gastrointestinal complications , delirium , postoperative insulin use and peak blood glucose , and all-cause mortality at 6 months . RESULTS	As of October 22 , 2013 , 7,034 patients have been recruited into SIRS in 82 centers from 18 countries . RESULTS	Patient 's mean age is 67.3 years , and 60.4 % are male . RESULTS	The average European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation is 7.0 with 22.1 % having an isolated coronary artery bypass graft procedure , and 66.1 % having a valve procedure . CONCLUSIONS	SIRS will lead to a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of prophylactic steroids for cardiac surgery requiring CBP ."
"BACKGROUND	Isotretinoin-Lidose , the first new formulation of isotretinoin in 30 years , differs from previously approved isotretinoin formulations in that it is less dependent on the presence of fat in the gut for absorption . OBJECTIVE	Evaluate the safety profiles of isotretinoin-Lidose and food-dependent generic isotretinoin in the largest clinical study with isotretinoin-925 randomized patients from 49 study sites . OBJECTIVE	Determine if the efficacy of this new formulation is noninferior to an existing isotretinoin . METHODS	Multicenter , double-blind , randomized , parallel-group , noninferiority trial . METHODS	Study medication was taken with meals twice daily for 20 weeks . METHODS	Patients were followed for 4 weeks after the last dose . METHODS	Safety evaluations included recordings of adverse events , assessments for depression , anxiety , emergent psychotic symptoms , and suicidal ideation/behavior , as well as DEXA and X-ray evaluations and changes in bone age . METHODS	Two co-primary efficacy outcomes were measured to assess noninferiority : a ) change in total nodular facial and truncal lesion count at from baseline to week 20 and b ) percentage of patients who experienced at least 90 % reduction in nodular facial and truncal lesion count from baseline to week 20 . CONCLUSIONS	Although isotretinoin-Lidose can be taken without meals , it was given with food because the absorption of both formulations in the study had to be similar to detect noninferiority . RESULTS	The safety profile of the 2 formulations was comparable . RESULTS	Criteria for noninferiority for both co-primary efficacy outcomes were met based on predetermined margins . CONCLUSIONS	Safety and efficacy of isotretinoin-Lidose is similar and noninferior to food-dependent generic isotretinoin , respectively ."
"BACKGROUND	Colchicine is effective for the treatment of acute pericarditis and first recurrences . BACKGROUND	However , conclusive data are lacking for the efficacy and safety of colchicine for treatment of multiple recurrences of pericarditis . METHODS	We did this multicentre , double-blind trial at four general hospitals in northern Italy . METHODS	Adult patients with multiple recurrences of pericarditis ( two ) were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to placebo or colchicine ( 05 mg twice daily for 6 months for patients weighing more than 70 kg or 05 mg once daily for patients weighing 70 kg or less ) in addition to conventional anti-inflammatory treatment with aspirin , ibuprofen , or indometacin . METHODS	Permuted block randomisation ( size four ) was done with a central computer-based automated sequence . METHODS	Patients and all investigators were masked to treatment allocation . METHODS	The primary outcome was recurrent pericarditis in the intention-to-treat population . METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00235079 . RESULTS	240 patients were enrolled and 120 were assigned to each group . RESULTS	The proportion of patients who had recurrent pericarditis was 26 ( 216 % ) of 120 in the colchicine group and 51 ( 425 % ) of 120 in the placebo group ( relative risk 049 ; 95 % CI 024-065 ; p = 00009 ; number needed to treat 5 ) . RESULTS	Adverse effects and discontinuation of study drug occurred in much the same proportions in each group . RESULTS	The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal intolerance ( nine patients in the colchicine group vs nine in the placebo group ) and hepatotoxicity ( three vs one ) . RESULTS	No serious adverse events were reported . CONCLUSIONS	Colchicine added to conventional anti-inflammatory treatment significantly reduced the rate of subsequent recurrences of pericarditis in patients with multiple recurrences . CONCLUSIONS	Taken together with results from other randomised controlled trials , these findings suggest that colchicine should be probably regarded as a first-line treatment for either acute or recurrent pericarditis in the absence of contraindications or specific indications .

"OBJECTIVE	To determine whether the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 reduces crying or fussing in a broad community based sample of breastfed infants and formula fed infants with colic aged less than 3 months . METHODS	Double blind , placebo controlled randomised trial . METHODS	Community based sample ( primary and secondary level care centres ) in Melbourne , Australia . METHODS	167 breastfed infants or formula fed infants aged less than 3 months meeting Wessel 's criteria for crying or fussing : 85 were randomised to receive probiotic and 82 to receive placebo . METHODS	Oral daily L reuteri ( 1 10 ( 8 ) colony forming units ) versus placebo for one month . METHODS	The primary outcome was daily duration of cry or fuss at 1 month . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were duration of cry or fuss ; number of cry or fuss episodes ; sleep duration of infant at 7 , 14 , and 21 days , and 1 and 6 months ; maternal mental health ( Edinburgh postnatal depression subscale ) ; family functioning ( paediatric quality of life inventory ) , parent quality adjusted life years ( assessment of quality of life ) at 1 and 6 months ; infant functioning ( paediatric quality of life inventory ) at 6 months ; infant faecal microbiota ( microbial diversity , colonisation with Escherichia coli ) , and calprotectin levels at 1 month . METHODS	In intention to treat analyses the two groups were compared using regression models adjusted for potential confounders . RESULTS	Of 167 infants randomised from August 2011 to August 2012 , 127 ( 76 % ) were retained to primary outcome ; of these , a subset was analysed for faecal microbial diversity , E coli colonisation , and calprotectin levels . RESULTS	Adherence was high . RESULTS	Mean daily cry or fuss time fell steadily in both groups . RESULTS	At 1 month , the probiotic group cried or fussed 49 minutes more than the placebo group ( 95 % confidence interval 8 to 90 minutes , P = 0.02 ) ; this mainly reflected more fussing , especially for formula fed infants . RESULTS	The groups were similar on all secondary outcomes . RESULTS	No study related adverse events occurred . CONCLUSIONS	L reuteri DSM 17938 did not benefit a community sample of breastfed infants and formula fed infants with colic . CONCLUSIONS	These findings differ from previous smaller trials of selected populations and do not support a general recommendation for the use of probiotics to treat colic in infants .

"OBJECTIVE	A treatment strategy to inhibit nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) - induced small intestinal lesions has not yet been established . OBJECTIVE	To clarify whether monotherapy with a gastromucoprotective drug , geranylgeranylacetone ( GGA ) , inhibits NSAID-induced acute mucosal injury of the upper digestive tract and small intestine . METHODS	A prospective , randomized , comparative study . METHODS	All procedures were performed at Osaka Medical College . METHODS	The subjects , thirty healthy adult volunteers , were randomly divided into two groups . METHODS	In the NSAID-GGA group , 75 mg/day of diclofenac sodium and 150 mg/day of GGA were orally administered for two weeks . METHODS	In the NSAID-FAM group , 75 mg/day of diclofenac sodium and 20 mg/day of famotidine ( FAM ) were orally administered for two weeks . METHODS	esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) and video capsule endoscopy ( VCE ) were performed before and two weeks after drug administration . METHODS	In addition , we measured fecal occult blood reactions and the fecal calprotectin levels . RESULTS	No significant differences were observed between the groups in the mean increase in esophageal/gastroduodenal lesions . RESULTS	The mean increases in the scores in the NSAID-FAM group ( NSAID-GGA group ) of small bowel lesions were as follows : erythema : 1.93 0.67 ( 0.30 0.60 ) , erosions : 1.13 0.54 ( 0.38 0.35 ) , ulcers : 0.73 0.33 ( 0.07 0.07 ) and edema : 0.53 0.44 ( 0.07 0.07 ) . RESULTS	The scores for erythema and ulcers were significantly lower in the NSAID-GGA group than in the NSAID-FAM group ( p = 0.032 and 0.0165 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS	We compared the prophylactic effects of a mucoprotective drug , GGA , and an H2RA , famotidine , on mucosal injury involving the esophagus to the small intestine related to the two-week oral administration of diclofenac sodium in healthy volunteers . CONCLUSIONS	In the upper digestive tract , the prophylactic effects were similar between the two drugs . CONCLUSIONS	However , in the small intestine , GGA more markedly inhibited the development of lesions compared to famotidine ."
"OBJECTIVE	To examine the effect of an oral prenatal probiotic on group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) colonization and to demonstrate the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial . METHODS	This pilot study was an open-label , two-group quasi-experiment . METHODS	An urban central city nurse-midwifery and wellness center serving a diverse population . METHODS	Ten pregnant participants received the oral probiotic ( Florajen3 ) taken once daily , and 10 participants served as controls . METHODS	A questionnaire on dietary practices , vaginal cleansing , sexual history , and symptoms and GBS colony count samples were taken at 28 - , 32 - , and 36-weeks gestation . RESULTS	Participants in the probiotic group reported no adverse events or minor side effects ; one half reported improved gastrointestinal symptoms . RESULTS	Although two women in each group had positive qualitative prenatal GBS cultures at 36 weeks , the probiotic group participants had lower quantitative GBS colony counts . RESULTS	The eight GBS negative averaged 90 % probiotic adherence compared with two GBS positive women who averaged 68 % . RESULTS	Yogurt ingestion was inversely related ( p = .02 ) to GBS colonization . CONCLUSIONS	Prenatal probiotic therapy has the potential to reduce GBS colonization . CONCLUSIONS	The potential of the probiotic intervention appears to be linked to daily adherence . CONCLUSIONS	A controlled clinical trial with a larger , adequately powered sample is feasible and justified ."
"BACKGROUND	Dietary fibers are associated with enhanced satiety . BACKGROUND	However , the mechanism of different dietary fibers contributing to satiety-related gastrointestinal ( GI ) peptide release , especially in an obese population , is still poorly understood . BACKGROUND	Polydextrose ( PDX ) , a water-soluble glucose polymer , has demonstrated its ability to reduce energy intake at a subsequent meal , but its mechanism of action requires further research . BACKGROUND	Also , there is limited evidence on its capacity to regulate subjective feelings of appetite . BACKGROUND	This study examines the effects of PDX on postprandial secretion of satiety-related GI peptides , short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , lactic acid , and subjective appetite ratings in obese participants . METHODS	18 non-diabetic , obese participants ( 42.0 y , 33.6 kg/m2 ) consumed a high-fat meal ( 4293 kJ , 36 % from fat ) with or without PDX ( 15 g ) in an acute , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled and crossover trial . METHODS	Postprandial plasma concentrations of satiety-related peptides , namely ghrelin , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , and peptide YY ( PYY ) , as well as SCFAs and lactic acid were assessed . METHODS	GI peptide , SCFA and lactate concentrations were then modeled using a linear mixed-effects model.The subjective feelings of hunger , satisfaction , and desire to eat were evaluated using visual analogue scales ( VAS ) , which were analyzed as incremental areas under the curve ( iAUC ) during the satiation and satiety periods . RESULTS	We found that PDX supplementation increased plasma GLP-1 levels more than the placebo treatment ( P = 0.02 ) . RESULTS	In the whole group , GLP-1 concentrations found in participants older than 40 years old were significantly lower ( P = 0.01 ) as compared to those aged 40 years or less . RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in postprandial ghrelin , CCK , or PYY responses . RESULTS	The lactic acid concentrations were significantly ( P = 0.01 ) decreased in the PDX group , while no significant changes in SCFAs were found . RESULTS	PDX reduced iAUC for hunger by 40 % ( P = 0.03 ) and marginally increased satisfaction by 22.5 % ( P = 0.08 ) during the post-meal satiety period . CONCLUSIONS	Polydextrose increased the postprandial secretion of the satiety hormone GLP-1 and reduced hunger after a high-fat meal . CONCLUSIONS	PDX also reduced the elevated postprandial lactic acid levels in plasma . CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , PDX may offer an additional means to regulate inter-meal satiety and improve postprandial metabolism in obese participants ."
"OBJECTIVE	Although combination pharmacotherapy is common in child and adolescent psychiatry , there has been little research evaluating it . OBJECTIVE	The value of adding risperidone to concurrent psychostimulant and parent training ( PT ) in behavior management for children with severe aggression was tested . METHODS	One hundred sixty-eight children 6 to 12 years old ( mean age 8.89 2.01 years ) with severe physical aggression were randomized to a 9-week trial of PT , stimulant ( STIM ) , and placebo ( Basic treatment ; n = 84 ) or PT , STIM , and risperidone ( Augmented treatment ; n = 84 ) . METHODS	All had diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional-defiant disorder ( n = 124 ) or conduct disorder ( n = 44 ) . METHODS	Children received psychostimulant ( usually Osmotic Release Oral System methylphenidate ) for 3 weeks , titrated for optimal effect , while parents received PT . METHODS	If there was room for improvement at the end of week 3 , placebo or risperidone was added . METHODS	Assessments included parent ratings on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form ( Disruptive-Total subscale was the primary outcome ) and Antisocial Behavior Scale ; blinded clinicians rated change on the Clinical Global Impressions scale . RESULTS	Compared with Basic treatment ( PT + STIM [ 44.8 14.6 mg/day ] + placebo [ 1.88 mg/day 0.72 ] ) , Augmented treatment ( PT + STIM [ 46.1 16.8 mg/day ] + risperidone [ 1.65 mg/day 0.75 ] ) showed statistically significant improvement onthe Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive-Total subscale ( treatment-by-time interaction , p = .0016 ) , the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Social Competence subscale ( p = .0049 ) , and Antisocial Behavior Scale Reactive Aggression subscale ( p = .01 ) . RESULTS	Clinical Global Impressions scores weresubstantially improved for the 2 groups but did not discriminate between treatments ( Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score2 , 70 % forBasic treatment versus 79 % for Augmented treatment ) . RESULTS	Prolactin elevations and gastrointestinal upset occurred more with Augmented treatment ; other adverse events differed modestly from Basic treatment ; weight gain in the Augmented treatment group was minor . CONCLUSIONS	Risperidone provided moderate butvariable improvement in aggressive and other seriously disruptive child behaviorswhenadded to PT and optimized stimulant treatment .

"BACKGROUND	Levodopa is the most effective therapy for Parkinson 's disease , but chronic treatment is associated with the development of potentially disabling motor complications . BACKGROUND	Experimental studies suggest that motor complications are due to non-physiological , intermittent administration of the drug , and can be reduced with continuous delivery . BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel delivered continuously through an intrajejunal percutaneous tube . METHODS	In our 12-week , randomised , double-blind , double-dummy , double-titration trial , we enrolled adults ( aged 30 years ) with advanced Parkinson 's disease and motor complications at 26 centres in Germany , New Zealand , and the USA . METHODS	Eligible participants had jejunal placement of a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube , and were then randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) to treatment with immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa plus placebo intestinal gel infusion or levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion plus oral placebo . METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by site , with a mixed block size of 2 or 4 . METHODS	The primary endpoint was change from baseline to final visit in motor off-time . METHODS	We assessed change in motor on-time without troublesome dyskinesia as a prespecified key secondary outcome . METHODS	We assessed efficacy in a full-analysis set of participants with data for baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment , and imputed missing data with the last observation carried forward approach . METHODS	We assessed safety in randomly allocated patients who underwent the percutaneous gastrojejunostomy procedure . METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , numbers NCT00660387 and NCT0357994 . RESULTS	From baseline to 12 weeks in the full-analysis set , mean off-time decreased by 4.04 h ( SE 0.65 ) for 35 patients allocated to the levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel group compared with a decrease of 2.14 h ( 0.66 ) for 31 patients allocated to immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa ( difference -1.91 h [ 95 % CI -3.05 to -0.76 ] ; p = 0.0015 ) . RESULTS	Mean on-time without troublesome dyskinesia increased by 4.11 h ( SE 0.75 ) in the intestinal gel group and 2.24 h ( 0.76 ) in the immediate-release oral group ( difference 1.86 [ 95 % CI 0.56 to 3.17 ] ; p = 0.0059 ) . RESULTS	In the safety analyses 35 ( 95 % ) of 37 patients allocated to the levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel group had adverse events ( five [ 14 % ] serious ) , as did 34 ( 100 % ) of 34 patients allocated to the immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa group ( seven [ 21 % ] serious ) , mainly associated with the percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube . CONCLUSIONS	Continuous delivery of levodopa-carbidopa with an intestinal gel offers a promising option for control of advanced Parkinson 's disease with motor complications . CONCLUSIONS	Benefits noted with intestinal gel delivery were of a greater magnitude than were those obtained with medical therapies to date , and our study is , to our knowledge , the first demonstration of the benefit of continuous levodopa delivery in a double-blind controlled study .

"BACKGROUND	The LUME-Lung 1 trial ( NCT00805194 ; Study 1199.13 ) demonstrated a significant overall survival ( OS ) advantage for nintedanib plus docetaxel compared with placebo plus docetaxel as second-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and adenocarcinoma histology . BACKGROUND	Patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) for symptoms and health-related quality of life ( QoL ) are reported here . METHODS	PROs were assessed at screening , on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle , at the end of active treatment , and at the first follow-up visit . METHODS	PRO instruments were the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and Lung Cancer-13 supplement , and the EuroQol disease-generic questionnaire ( EQ-5D and EQ-VAS ) . METHODS	Analyses of PRO items for lung cancer-specific symptoms of cough , dyspnoea and pain were prespecified . RESULTS	Rates of questionnaire completion were high . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in time to deterioration of global health status/QoL , or symptoms of cough , dyspnoea or pain , between the treatment groups for both the overall study population and the adenocarcinoma population . RESULTS	Time to deterioration of some gastrointestinal events was shorter with nintedanib versus placebo . RESULTS	Longitudinal analysis for the adenocarcinoma population showed comparable changes between the groups in symptom scores over time , with numerical differences in favour of nintedanib for cough and pain scales , and significant reductions in some pain items with nintedanib versus placebo . RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in EQ-5D or EQ-VAS between the groups . CONCLUSIONS	The significant OS benefit observed with the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel therapy was achieved with no detrimental effect on patient self-reported QoL ."
"BACKGROUND	Age-related cognitive decline ( ARCD ) is of major societal concern in an ageing population , with the development of dietary supplements providing a promising avenue for amelioration of associated deficits . BACKGROUND	Despite initial interest in the use of phospholipids ( PLs ) for ARCD , in recent years there has been a hiatus in such research . BACKGROUND	Because of safety concerns regarding PLs derived from bovine cortex , and the equivocal efficacy of soybean-derived PLs , there is an important need for the development of new PL alternatives . BACKGROUND	Phospholipids derived from milk proteins represent one potential candidate treatment . METHODS	In order to reduce the effects of age-associated memory impairment ( AAMI ) the Phospholipid Intervention for Cognitive Ageing Reversal ( PLICAR ) was developed to test the efficacy of a milk protein concentrate rich in natural , non-synthetic milk phospholipids ( Lacprodan PL-20 ) . METHODS	PLICAR is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel-groups study where 150 ( N = 50/group ) AAMI participants aged > 55 years will be randomized to receive a daily supplement of Lacprodan PL-20 or one of two placebos ( phospholipid-free milk protein concentrate or inert rice starch ) over a 6-month ( 180-day ) period . METHODS	Participants will undergo testing at baseline , 90 days and 180 days . METHODS	The primary outcome is a composite memory score from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include cognitive ( verbal learning , working memory , prospective and retrospective memory , processing speed and attention ) , mood ( depression , anxiety , stress and visual analogue scales ) , cardiovascular ( blood pressure , blood velocity and pulse wave pressure ) , gastrointestinal microbiota and biochemical measures ( oxidative stress , inflammation , B vitamins and Homocysteine , glucoregulation and serum choline ) . METHODS	Allelic differences in the Apolipoprotein E and ( APOE ) and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) gene will be included for subgroup analysis . METHODS	A subset ( N = 60 ; 20/group ) ) will undergo neuroimaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) in order to further explore in vivo central mechanisms of action of Lacprodan PL-20 . METHODS	This study will enable evaluation of the efficacy of milk-derived phospholipids for AAMI , and their mechanisms of action .

"BACKGROUND	Delayed gastric emptying ( DGE ) is a major problem after pancreatoduodenectomy ( PD ) . BACKGROUND	A recent multicentre randomized trial reported no difference in gastric emptying rates between retrocolic and antecolic reconstruction routes . BACKGROUND	The present study looked at quality of life with these two approaches and the correlation with gastric emptying . METHODS	This was a substudy of patients completing a panel of quality-of-life questionnaires within a randomized trial comparing retrocolic and antecolic gastroenteric reconstruction after PD . METHODS	Gastric emptying was assessed by scintigraphy 1week after surgery . METHODS	Quality of life was measured with the EuroQoL - 5D questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) , the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire ( QLQ-C30 ) with its pancreatic cancer module ( PAN26 ) , and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index ( GIQLI ) . RESULTS	There were 38 patients in the retrocolic and 35 in the antecolic group . RESULTS	Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were similar in the two groups . RESULTS	Median time to half-emptying of stomach content after surgery was 145 and 64min in the retrocolic and antecolic group respectively ( P = 0.189 ) . RESULTS	Median percentages of residual activity after 2h were 64 and 28 per cent respectively ( P = 0.213 ) . RESULTS	Quality of life did not differ at any time point between the groups . RESULTS	At 2weeks after surgery , patients with DGE had significantly worse outcomes on two EQ-5D domains , ten QLQ-C30 / PAN26 subscales , and two GIQLI subscales and total score . RESULTS	Effect sizes were moderate to large . CONCLUSIONS	The route of gastroenteric reconstruction after PD does not influence either gastric emptying at scintigraphy or quality of life . CONCLUSIONS	The impact of DGE on quality of life is clinically significant . CONCLUSIONS	Registration number NTR1697 ( www.trialregister.nl ) ."
"OBJECTIVE	The present study aimed at investigating the effects of Lactobacillus casei 01 supplementation on symptoms and inflammatory biomarkers of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) in women . METHODS	In this randomized double-blind clinical trial , female patients with established RA for more than 1 year , 20-80 years of age and body mass index ( BMI ) lower than 40 , who followed stable medication for 3 months prior to the supplementation , were randomly allocated to receive either one capsule containing 10 ( 8 ) colony forming units ( CFU ) of L. casei 01 , or a placebo for 8 weeks ; allocation was stratified by BMI and menopausal status . METHODS	Disease activity score-28 ( DAS28 ) was calculated , European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) response was evaluated and the cytokines , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - were measured . RESULTS	Thirty patients were recruited in each group ; 22 and 24 patients were analyzed in the probiotic and placebo groups , respectively . RESULTS	L. casei 01 supplementation decreased serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) levels , tender and swollen joint counts , global health ( GH ) score and DAS28 ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	More patients in the L. casei 01 group had moderate response to the treatment , based on the EULAR criteria , at the end of the study ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	At the end of the study , a significant difference was observed between the two groups for IL-10 , IL-12 and TNF - changes through the study course ( P < 0.05 ) , in favor of the probiotic group . RESULTS	No adverse effects were reported for the intervention . CONCLUSIONS	Probiotic supplementation may be an appropriate adjunct therapy for RA patients and help alleviate symptoms and improve inflammatory cytokines ."
"BACKGROUND	In-home iron fortification for infants in developing countries is recommended for control of anaemia , but low absorption typically results in > 80 % of the iron passing into the colon . BACKGROUND	Iron is essential for growth and virulence of many pathogenic enterobacteria . BACKGROUND	We determined the effect of high and low dose in-home iron fortification on the infant gut microbiome and intestinal inflammation . METHODS	We performed two double-blind randomised controlled trials in 6-month-old Kenyan infants ( n = 115 ) consuming home-fortified maize porridge daily for 4 months . METHODS	In the first , infants received a micronutrient powder ( MNP ) containing 2.5 mg iron as NaFeEDTA or the MNP without iron . METHODS	In the second , they received a different MNP containing 12.5 mg iron as ferrous fumarate or the MNP without the iron . METHODS	The primary outcome was gut microbiome composition analysed by 16S pyrosequencing and targeted real-time PCR ( qPCR ) . METHODS	Secondary outcomes included faecal calprotectin ( marker of intestinal inflammation ) and incidence of diarrhoea . METHODS	We analysed the trials separately and combined . RESULTS	At baseline , 63 % of the total microbial 16S rRNA could be assigned to Bifidobacteriaceae but there were high prevalences of pathogens , including Salmonella Clostridium difficile , Clostridium perfringens , and pathogenic Escherichia coli . RESULTS	Using pyrosequencing , + FeMNPs increased enterobacteria , particularly Escherichia/Shigella ( p = 0.048 ) , the enterobacteria/bifidobacteria ratio ( p = 0.020 ) , and Clostridium ( p = 0.030 ) . RESULTS	Most of these effects were confirmed using qPCR ; for example , + FeMNPs increased pathogenic E. coli strains ( p = 0.029 ) . RESULTS	+ FeMNPs also increased faecal calprotectin ( p = 0.002 ) . RESULTS	During the trial , 27.3 % of infants in +12.5 mgFeMNP required treatment for diarrhoea versus 8.3 % in -12.5 mgFeMNP ( p = 0.092 ) . RESULTS	There were no study-related serious adverse events in either group . CONCLUSIONS	In this setting , provision of iron-containing MNPs to weaning infants adversely affects the gut microbiome , increasing pathogen abundance and causing intestinal inflammation .

"BACKGROUND	Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction ( PGD ) is one of the most common complications following major surgeries under general anesthesia ( GA ) . BACKGROUND	Despite ongoing research and new drug treatments , abdominal distension within 24 h postoperatively occurs in 8 % -28 % of all surgeries . BACKGROUND	We aim to analyze the effectiveness of preventing PGD by preoperatively stimulating Neiguan ( PC6 ) , Zusanli ( ST36 ) and Shangjuxu ( ST37 ) bilaterally twice a day compared with sham-acupuncture treatment and standard treatment . METHODS	This is a single-center , prospective practical randomized controlled trial . METHODS	All groups will be given standard treatments . METHODS	Patients undergoing vascular surgery under GA will be included from the Vascular Surgery Unit in West China Hospital of Sichuan University , China , and divided into three groups . METHODS	The experimental group will receive routine treatments and acupuncture at PC6 , ST36 and ST37 bilaterally with electrical stimulation twice a day for 20 min preoperatively . METHODS	The sham-acupuncture group will receive pseudo-electroacupuncture at sham acupoints of PC6 , ST36 and ST37 , which are 1 cun away from the real acupoints . METHODS	The routine-treatment group will not receive electroacupuncture . METHODS	The outcomes include the incidence of abdominal distention , abdominal circumference , the degree of abdominal distension , the first time of flatus and defecation , and hospitalization duration . CONCLUSIONS	The results from this study will demonstrate whether preoperative electroacupuncture is an effective method for the prevention of PGD in patients undergoing vascular surgery under GA. .

METHODS	The efficacy , each symptom score , serum interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) were observed . RESULTS	( 1 ) After treatment , the total effective rate was 98.3 % ( 59/60 ) in the observation group , which was significantly higher than 86.7 % ( 52/60 ) in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( The improvement rates of ulceration , edema , erosion and polyp in the observation group were obviously higher than those in the control group ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( 3 ) After treatment , the symptom scores of diarrhea , bloody purulent stool , abdominal pain , tenesmus as well as inflammatory factors of IL-1beta , IL-6 and TNF-alpha were all improved compared with those before treatment in the two groups ( all P < 0.05 ) ; the differences between the observation , group and control group were statistically significant ( all P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	( 4 ) During the 3-month follow up visit , the recurrence rate was 1.7 % ( 1/59 ) in the observation group , which was significantly lower than 11.5 % ( 6/52 ) in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The Gexia Zhuyu decoction combined with acupuncture at Zusanli ( ST 36 ) could effectively improve efficacy , reduce recurrence rate , relieve clinical symptoms and prompt recovery of mucous membrane in patients with damp-heat ulcerative colitis at active phase , which is related with reducing the expression of inflammation ."
"OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt drink on the health , growth , and quality of life of healthy children 12-48 months of age in out-of-home child care . METHODS	Healthy children attending child care centers were enrolled in a prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . METHODS	The intervention was a yogurt drink containing Streptococcus thermophilus , Lactobacillus bulgaricus , and Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis ( BB-12 ) ( 5 10 ( 9 ) cfu/100 mL serving ) , and 1 g of inulin ( synbiotic group ) vs a similar nonsynbiotic-containing acidified milk drink ( placebo group ) once daily for 16 weeks . METHODS	The end points were days of diarrhea , fever , vomiting , symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection , use of antibiotics , physician visits , child care absenteeism , parental work absenteeism , and quality of life ( PedsQL 4.0 ; Mapi Research Trust , Lyon , France ) . RESULTS	Compared with placebo ( n = 73 ) , children receiving synbiotic ( n = 76 ) had significantly fewer days of reported fever ( 1.85 vs 1.95 , P < .05 ) , significant improvement in social functioning ( P < .035 ; pre-to-end intervention ) , and school functioning ( P < .045 ; pre-to-mid intervention ) . RESULTS	More days with 3 loose/watery stools were reported in the synbiotic group ( P < .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Daily supplementation of children 's diet with yogurt containing probiotic bacteria BB-12 and inulin significantly reduced days of fever and improved social and school functioning . CONCLUSIONS	The increased frequency of bowel movements may be explained by an accelerating effect of BB-12 and inulin on intestinal transit . CONCLUSIONS	Further research on the possible benefits of synbiotics on children 's health is advised . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT00653705 ."
"BACKGROUND	Rifamycin SV is under development for treatment of travelers ' diarrhea ( TD ) in a new oral formulation , Rifamycin SV MMX ( RIF-MMX ; Santarus Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) , which targets its delivery to the colon , making it a unique rifamycin drug . METHODS	This was a randomized , double-blind , phase 3 study of adult travelers to Mexico or Guatemala experiencing acute diarrhea . METHODS	A total of 264 patients received RIF-MMX ( 2200mg twice daily for 3days , n = 199 ) or placebo ( n = 65 ) in a 3:1 ratio . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the length of time between the administration of first dose of study drug and passage of the last unformed stool ( TLUS ; after which clinical cure was declared ) . METHODS	Other endpoints included eradication of pathogens from the stools , pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , and adverse events ( AEs ) . RESULTS	TLUS was significantly shorter in the RIF-MMX group ( median : 46.0 hours ) compared with placebo ( median : 68.0 hours ; p = 0.0008 ) and a larger percentage of RIF-MMX treated patients ( 81.4 % ) achieved clinical cure compared with placebo patients ( 56.9 % ) . RESULTS	TLUS was significantly shorter in the subgroups of patients with enteroaggregative , enterotoxigenic , or diffusely adherent Escherichia coli infections ( p = 0.0035 ) with nonsignificant activity against invasive bacteria ( p = 0.3804 ) . RESULTS	Overall pathogen eradication rates were numerically higher in the RIF-MMX group ( 67.0 % ) compared with placebo ( 54.8 % ) but the difference did not reach significance ( p = 0.0836 ) . RESULTS	In vitro resistance to rifamycin SV was observed in some bacteria remaining after treatment of patients with RIF-MMX but was not associated with lower efficacy in them . RESULTS	AEs appeared to be more frequent with placebo ( 38.5 % ) than with RIF-MMX ( 29.6 % ) . CONCLUSIONS	RIF-MMX shortened the duration of TD in patients with a broad range of pathogens and was well tolerated . CONCLUSIONS	The unique pharmacokinetic properties of the drug offer evidence that TD pathogens work at the level of the colon ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy ofprobiotics , Lactobacillus casei ( Shirvta strain ) , in reducing the incidence ofventilator - associated pneumonia ( VAP ) in medical patients who received mechanical ventilation at Siriraj Hospital . METHODS	A prospective , randomized , open-label controlled trial was conducted in 150 adult hospitalized patients in medical wards who were expected to receive mechanical ventilation for 72 hours or longer : The patients were randomized to the probiotics group or the control group . METHODS	All patients received regular care for mechanical ventilation . METHODS	The patients in the probiotics group received 80 ml of Lactobacillus casei ( Shirota strain ) for oral care after having standard oral care once daily and additional 80 ml of the aforementionedfermented dairy product was given via enteralfeeding once daily . METHODS	The primary outcomes were incidence of VAP and incidence rate of VAP episodes per 1,000 ventilator-days . METHODS	The secondary outcomes were length ofhospital stay , mortality at day 28 and 90 , incidence ofdiarrhea , andpresence of resistant bacteria in oropharyngeal and rectal swab samples taken from the patients at baseline , day 7 and day 28 after enrollment . RESULTS	The baseline characteristics of the patients in the probiotics group ( 75 ) and the control group ( 75 ) were not significantly different . RESULTS	The patients in the probiotics group were less likely to develop VAP compared with the control group ( 24 % vs. 29.3 % , p = 0.46 ) , respectively . RESULTS	The incidence rates of VAP in the probiotics and control groups were 22.64 and 30.22 episodes per 1,000 ventilator-days , respectively ( p = 0.37 ) . RESULTS	A trend of lower prevalence of some resistant bacteria cultured from oropharyngeal swabs in the probiotics group than that in the control group was observed . RESULTS	Overall 28 - and 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay of the patients in both groups were not significantly different . CONCLUSIONS	Administration of probiotics containing Lactobacillus casei ( Shirota strain ) has a tendency to reduce the incidence of VAP and colonization with resistant bacteria in oropharyngeal cavity without significant effects on mortality and length of hospital stay ."
"BACKGROUND	Emerging evidence suggests modulating the microbiota in the large bowel of patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) through pre - and/probiotic supplementation may inhibit the development of key nephrovascular toxins . BACKGROUND	To date , quality intervention trials investigating this novel treatment in CKD are lacking . BACKGROUND	The aim of SYNERGY is to assess the effectiveness of synbiotics ( co-administration of pre - and probiotics ) as a potential treatment targeting the synthesis of uremic toxins , specifically , indoxyl sulphate ( IS ) and p-cresyl sulphate ( PCS ) . METHODS	Thirty-seven patients with moderate to severe CKD ( Stage IV and V , pre-dialysis ) will be recruited to a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised cross-over trial . METHODS	Patients will be provided with synbiotic therapy or placebo for 6 weeks , with a 4week washout before cross-over . METHODS	The primary outcome is serum IS , total and free ( unbound ) concentrations , measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography . METHODS	Secondary outcomes include serum PCS , total and free ( unbound ) concentrations ; cardiovascular risk , measured by serum lipopolysaccharides , serum trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO ) and inflammation and oxidative stress markers ; kidney damage , measured by 24hour proteinuria and albuminuria , estimated glomerular filtration rate and renal tubule damage ( urinary kidney injury molecule-1 ) ; patients ' self assessed quality of life ; and gastrointestinal symptoms . METHODS	In addition , the effects on the community structure of the stool microbiota will be explored in a subset of patients to validate the mechanistic rationale underpinning the synbiotic therapy . CONCLUSIONS	IS and PCS are two novel uremic toxins implicated in both cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and progression of CKD . CONCLUSIONS	Preliminary studies indicate that synbiotic therapy maybe a promising strategy when considering a targeted , tolerable and cost-efficient therapy for lowering serum IS and PCS concentrations . CONCLUSIONS	This trial will provide high quality ` proof-of-concept ' data to elucidate both the efficacy of synbiotic therapy for lowering the toxins and whether reductions in serum IS and PCS translate into clinical benefits . CONCLUSIONS	Considering the potential of pre - and probiotics to not only shift toxin levels , but to also impede CVD and CKD progression , SYNERGY will provide vital insight into the effectiveness of this innocuous nutritional therapy .

"BACKGROUND	Omega-3 fatty acids in free fatty acid form have enhanced bioavailability , and plasma levels are less influenced by food than for ethyl ester forms . OBJECTIVE	The aim was to evaluate the safety and lipid-altering efficacy in subjects with severe hypertriglyceridemia of an investigational pharmaceutical omega-3 free fatty acid ( OM3-FFA ) containing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid . METHODS	This was a multinational , double-blind , randomized , out-patient study . METHODS	Men and women with triglycerides ( TGs ) 500 mg/dL , but < 2000 mg/dL , took control ( olive oil [ OO ] 4 g/d ; n = 99 ) , OM3-FFA 2 g/d ( plus OO 2 g/d ; n = 100 ) , OM3-FFA 3 g/d ( plus OO 1 g/d ; n = 101 ) , or OM3-FFA 4 g/d ( n = 99 ) capsules for 12 weeks in combination with the National Cholesterol Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet . RESULTS	Fasting serum TGs changed from baseline by -25.9 % ( P < .01 vs OO ) , -25.5 % ( P < .01 vs OO ) , and -30.9 % ( P < .001 vs OO ) with 2 , 3 , and 4 g/d OM3-FFA , respectively , compared with -4.3 % with OO . RESULTS	Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( non-HDL-C ) , total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio , very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , remnant-like particle cholesterol , apolipoprotein CIII , lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 , and arachidonic acid were significantly lowered ( P < .05 at each OM3-FFA dosage vs OO ) ; and plasma eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were significantly elevated ( P < .001 at each OM3-FFA dosage vs OO ) . RESULTS	With OM3-FFA 2 and 4 g/d ( but not 3 g/d ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly increased compared with OO ( P < .05 vs OO ) . RESULTS	High-sensitivity C-reactive protein responses with OM3-FFA did not differ significantly from the OO response at any dosage . RESULTS	Fewer subjects reported any adverse event with OO vs OM3-FFA , but frequencies across dosage groups were similar . RESULTS	Discontinuation due to adverse event , primarily gastrointestinal , ranged from 5 % to 7 % across OM3-FFA dosage groups vs 0 % for OO . CONCLUSIONS	OM3-FFA achieved the primary end point for TG lowering and secondary end point of non-HDL-C lowering at 2 , 3 , and 4 g/d in persons with severe hypertriglyceridemia . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01242527 ."

"BACKGROUND	Recent studies have reported beneficial effects of probiotics on maternal glycemia in healthy pregnant women . BACKGROUND	Obesity significantly increases risk of impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy , but glycemic effects of probiotics in this specific obstetric group require additional investigation . OBJECTIVE	The aim of the Probiotics in Pregnancy Study was to investigate the effect of a probiotic capsule on maternal fasting glucose in obese pregnant women . METHODS	In this placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized trial , 175 pregnant women with an early pregnancy body mass index ( BMI ; in kg/m ) from 30.0 to 39.9 were recruited from antenatal clinics at the National Maternity Hospital , Dublin , Ireland . METHODS	Exclusion criteria were BMI < 30.0 or > 39.9 , prepregnancy or gestational diabetes , age < 18 y , multiple pregnancy , and fetal anomaly . METHODS	Women were randomly assigned to receive either a daily probiotic or a placebo capsule from 24 to 28 wk of gestation in addition to routine antenatal care . METHODS	The primary outcome was the change in fasting glucose between groups from preintervention to postintervention . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were the incidence of gestational diabetes and neonatal anthropometric measures . RESULTS	In 138 women who completed the study ( 63 women in the probiotic group ; 75 women in the placebo group ) , mean ( SD ) early pregnancy BMI was 33.6 2.6 , which differed significantly between probiotic ( 32.9 2.4 ) and placebo ( 34.1 2.7 ) groups . RESULTS	With adjustment for BMI , the change in maternal fasting glucose did not differ significantly between treated and control groups [ -0.09 0.27 compared with -0.07 0.39 mmol/L ; P = 0.391 ; B = -0.05 ( 95 % CI : -0.17 , 0.07 ) ] . RESULTS	There were also no differences in the incidence of impaired glycemia ( 16 % in the probiotic group compared with 15 % in the placebo group ; P = 0.561 ) , birth weight ( 3.70 kg in the probiotic group compared with 3.68 kg in the placebo group ; P = 0.723 ) , or other metabolic variables or pregnancy outcomes . RESULTS	A secondary analysis of 110 women , excluding antibiotic users and poor compliers , also revealed no differences in maternal glucose or other outcomes between groups . CONCLUSIONS	Probiotic treatment of 4 wk during pregnancy did not influence maternal fasting glucose , the metabolic profile , or pregnancy outcomes in obese women ."
"BACKGROUND	Enterocolitis ( EC ) is the most common and serious postoperative complication of Hirschsprung 's disease ( HD ) . BACKGROUND	Probiotics potentially play a protective role in maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity . BACKGROUND	Based on the beneficial effects of probiotics , we hypothesized that oral probiotics could decrease the incidence and severity of Hirschsprung 's disease-associated enterocolitis ( HAEC ) . METHODS	We conducted a prospective , multicenter , randomized , and controlled trial to assess whether oral probiotics could decrease the incidence and severity of HAEC . METHODS	HD patients were randomly assigned into the control group and probiotic-treated group . METHODS	All children in probiotic-treated group were fed with probiotics per day for 4weeks . METHODS	In next 3months , the incidence and severity of HAEC were analyzed . METHODS	The peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets and cytokines , including TNF - , IFN - , IL-6 , and IL-10 , were analyzed by flow cytometry and enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) . RESULTS	Compared with the control group , the incidence of HAEC in the probiotic-treated group was significantly diminished . RESULTS	The severity of EC was also remarkably decreased . RESULTS	Furthermore , probiotics balanced T lymphocyte subsets . RESULTS	Moreover , pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF - , IFN - , and IL-6 were significantly decreased and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was notably increased in probiotic-treated group . CONCLUSIONS	Probiotics not only significantly diminished the incidence but also decreased the severity of HAEC . CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , our study revealed that probiotics decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine and furthermore balanced T lymphocytes ( registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT number : NCT01934959 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	The objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed , missing and filled teeth ( DMF-T ) , habit of brushing teeth , and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children 's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution , then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children 's parents . METHODS	Included in the study were 187 children ( 96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine ) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months . METHODS	The children selected had not taken any antibiotics , antimicotics for three months and dental treatments during this trial . METHODS	The distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly . METHODS	After performing a survey for the education , occupation , and income status of the parents , the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded . METHODS	The children were given toothbrushes , toothpaste ( with fluroide ) , and the solutions ( including distilled water and chlorhexidine ) for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of each week . METHODS	The 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period . RESULTS	The decrease in the DMF-T index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education , income , and occupation status of the parents . RESULTS	Of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes , the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included Streptococcus mutans , Escherichia Coli , Pseudomonas aeuroginosa , Enterococcus spp , Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans . RESULTS	Except for Candida albicans , the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall . RESULTS	In the group using the solution with chlorhexidine , a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group . CONCLUSIONS	The findings of this study show that the education , occupation , and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children 's oral and dental health . CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health ."
"OBJECTIVE	To observe the effects of anesthetic intervention with small-dose lidocaine and ketamine on early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing surgeries for gastrointestinal tumors . METHODS	Sixty patients ( ASA I-III , aged 63-82 years ) scheduled for surgeries for gastrointestinal tumors were randomized into intervention group ( n = 30 ) and control group ( n = 30 ) . METHODS	After intravenous induction and tracheal intubation , the patients in the interventional group received intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg lidocaine and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine , followed by continuous infusion of lidocaine at the rate of 0.5 mgkg ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) till the end of the operation ; the patients in the control group received saline infusion only . METHODS	The cognitive function of the patients was assessed at 3 day before and 2 day after the operation using comprehensive neuro-psychological tests . METHODS	Peripheral venous blood was extracted before anesthesia induction ( T0 ) , at the end of the surgery ( T1 ) , and at 1 day ( T2 ) and 2 days ( T3 ) after the operation for measurement of serum S-100 protein , NSE and IL-6 levels using ELISA . RESULTS	The difference between the test scores before and after the operation ( X values ) was significantly smaller in the intervention group than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The intervention group showed a significantly lower incidence rate of postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) than the control group ( 6.7 % vs 33.3 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Compared with the control group , the intervention group exhibited significantly lower serum levels of S-100 protein , NSE and IL-6 at T1 ( P < 0.05 ) , significantly lower NSE and IL-6 levels at T2 ( P < 0.05 ) time point , and significantly lower IL-6 level at T3 ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Intravenous injection of small-dose lidocaine and ketamine during the operation can reduce the incidence of POCD in elderly patients undergoing surgeries for gastrointestinal tumors possibly in relation to decreased serum S-100 , NSE and IL-6 levels ."

"BACKGROUND	Consumption of a cholesterol lowering dietary portfolio including plant sterols ( PS ) , viscous fibre , soy proteins and nuts for 6 months improves blood lipid profile . BACKGROUND	Plant sterols reduce blood cholesterol by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption and concerns have been raised whether PS consumption reduces fat soluble vitamin absorption . OBJECTIVE	The objective was to determine effects of consumption of a cholesterol lowering dietary portfolio on circulating concentrations of PS and fat soluble vitamins . METHODS	Using a parallel design study , 351 hyperlipidemic participants from 4 centres across Canada were randomized to 1 of 3 groups . METHODS	Participants followed dietary advice with control or portfolio diet . METHODS	Participants on routine and intensive portfolio involved 2 and 7 clinic visits , respectively , over 6 months . RESULTS	No changes in plasma concentrations of and tocopherol , lutein , lycopene and retinol , but decreased - carotene concentrations were observed with intensive ( week 12 : p = 0.045 ; week 24 : p = 0.039 ) and routine ( week 12 : p = 0.031 ; week 24 : p = 0.078 ) portfolio groups compared to control . RESULTS	However , cholesterol adjusted - carotene and fat soluble compound concentrations were not different compared to control . RESULTS	Plasma PS concentrations were increased with intensive ( campesterol :p = 0.012 ; - sitosterol :p = 0.035 ) and routine ( campesterol : p = 0.034 ; - sitosterol : p = 0.080 ) portfolio groups compared to control . RESULTS	Plasma cholesterol-adjusted campesterol and - sitosterol concentrations were negatively correlated ( p < 0.001 ) with total and LDL-C levels . CONCLUSIONS	Results demonstrate that consuming a portfolio diet reduces serum total and LDL-C levels while increasing PS values , without altering fat soluble compounds concentrations . CONCLUSIONS	The extent of increments of PS with the current study are not deleterious and also maintaining optimum levels of fat soluble vitamins are of paramount necessity to maintain overall metabolism and health . CONCLUSIONS	Results indicate portfolio diet as one of the best options for CVD risk reduction . BACKGROUND	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00438425 ."
"OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to compare the use of amoxicillin ( 1g ) vs amoxicillin and clavulanate ( 875/125mg ) after extraction of retained third molars for prevention of infectious complications . METHODS	The study involved 546 patients attending for removal a retained third molar and divided in to two groups : Group 1 - amoxicillin and clavunate ( 875/125mg ) group ( n = 257 ) and Group 2 - amoxicillin ( 1g ) group ( n = 289 ) . METHODS	All patients were recalled for investigating the possibility of infection , presence of diarrhea and further analgesic intake . RESULTS	From a total of 546 patients , the frequency of infection was 1.4 % , without no statistically differences between the two groups . RESULTS	Group 1 showed statistically higher presence of patients with gastrointestinal complications ( p > 0.05 ) . RESULTS	In 546 patients , 2.7 % of patients reported severe pain that would not relieve with medication . CONCLUSIONS	The results of our study show that the use of amoxicillin ( 1g ) and amoxicillin and clavunate ( 875/125mg ) is similar efficacious in preventing infection after retained third molar extraction but amoxicillin and clavunate ( 875/125mg ) produces more gastrointestinal discomfort ."
"BACKGROUND	We compared the analgesic effects of caudal and ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block using bupivacaine-clonidine performed in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair . BACKGROUND	The ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block provides excellent pain relief for operations on the inguinal region , including emergency procedures ( e.g. strangulated inguinal hernia with intestinal obstruction ) . BACKGROUND	It should be preferred to caudal block for these procedures . METHODS	After local ethics committee approval and written parental consent , 67 ASA class I - II patients aged between 2-7 years old scheduled for elective inguinal hernia repair were allocated randomly into two groups after general anesthesia with same drugs in both groups . METHODS	Group C received caudal block with 1 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25 % combined with 1 g/kg clonidine , and group I received ilioinguinal - iliohypogastric nerve block with 0.3 ml / kg bupivacaine 0.25 % combined with 1 g/kg clonidine . METHODS	Blood pressure and heart rate were documented every 5 minutes . METHODS	Post-operative analgesia , analgesic use and side-effects were assessed during first 24 hours . RESULTS	In group C , 7 / 34 and in group I , 12/33 patients required post-operative analgesia ( P = 0.174 ) . RESULTS	Five patients ( 15.5 % ) in group I and one patient ( 2.94 % ) in group C had severe pain after operation . RESULTS	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased during operation , but the differences between two groups were not significant ( P = 0.176 , P = 0.111 ) . RESULTS	Heart rate changes between two groups were insignificant ( P = 0.182 ) . CONCLUSIONS	It seems that in children , caudal epidural block and ilioinguinal - iliohypogastric nerve block using bupivacaine-clonidine have comparable effects on analgesia , severity of pain and hemodynamic changes during and after surgery on inguinal region ."
"BACKGROUND	Calcium from different dairy sources might affect blood lipids and fecal fat excretion differently because of differences in the food matrix and nutritional composition . OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether milk - and cheese-based diets with similar calcium contents affect a saturated fatty acid-induced increase in blood lipids differently . METHODS	Fifteen healthy , young men participated in a randomized 3 2-wk crossover study in which the following 3 isocaloric diets that were similar in fat contents and compositions were compared : control diet [ nondairy diet ( ~ 500 mg Ca/d ) ] , milk diet [ semiskimmed milk-based diet ( 1700 mg Ca/d ) ] , and cheese diet [ semihard cow-cheese-based diet ( 1700 mg Ca/d ) ] . METHODS	Blood was drawn before and after each period , and feces were collected for 5 d during each period . RESULTS	Saturated fatty acid-induced increases in total and low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol were lower with the milk diet ( mean SD : 0.57 0.13 and 0.53 0.11 mmol/L , respectively ) ( P < 0.01 ) and cheese diet ( 0.41 0.15 and 0.47 0.12 mmol/L , respectively ) ( P < 0.05 ) than with the control diet ( 0.89 0.12 and 0.84 0.11 mmol/L , respectively ) . RESULTS	Fecal fat excretion increased more with the consumption of both the milk ( 5.2 0.4 g/d ) and cheese ( 5.7 0.4 g/d ) diets than with the control diet ( 3.9 0.3 g/d ) ( P < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Changes in blood pressure , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides , and lipid ratios did not differ . CONCLUSIONS	Compared with the control diet , milk - and cheese-based diets attenuated saturated fatty acid-induced increases in total and LDL cholesterol and resulted in increased fecal fat excretion ; however , effects of milk and cheese did not differ . CONCLUSIONS	Because the diets contained similar amounts of saturated fat , similar increases in total and LDL cholesterol could be expected ; however , both milk and cheese attenuated these responses , which seem to be explained by their calcium contents . CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01317251 ."
"BACKGROUND	Amino acids are well known to be key effectors of gut protein turnover . BACKGROUND	We recently reported that enteral delivery of proteins markedly stimulated global duodenal protein synthesis in carbohydrate-fed healthy humans , but specifically affected proteins remain unknown . OBJECTIVE	We aimed to assess the influence of an enteral protein supply on the duodenal mucosal proteome in carbohydrate-fed humans . METHODS	Six healthy volunteers received for 5 h , on 2 occasions and in random order , either an enteral infusion of maltodextrins alone ( 0.25 g kg h ) mimicking the fed state or maltodextrins with a protein powder ( 0.14 g proteins kg h ) . METHODS	Endoscopic duodenal biopsy specimens were then collected and frozen until analysis . METHODS	A 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-based comparative proteomics analysis was then performed , and differentially expressed proteins ( at least 1.5-fold change ; Student 's t test , P < 0.05 ) were identified by mass spectrometry . METHODS	Protein expression changes were confirmed by Western blot analysis . RESULTS	Thirty-two protein spots were differentially expressed after protein delivery compared with maltodextrins alone : 28 and 4 spots were up - or downregulated , respectively . RESULTS	Among the 22 identified proteins , 11 upregulated proteins were involved either in the cytoskeleton ( ezrin , moesin , plastin 1 , lamin B1 , vimentin , and - actin ) or in protein biosynthesis ( glutamyl-prolyl-transfer RNA synthetase , glutaminyl-transfer RNA synthetase , elongation factor 2 , elongation factor 1 , and eukaryotic translation and initiation factor 3 subunit f ) . CONCLUSIONS	Enteral delivery of proteins altered the duodenal mucosal proteome and mainly stimulated the expression of proteins involved in cytoskeleton and protein biosynthesis . CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that protein supply may affect intestinal morphology by stimulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling ."
"BACKGROUND	Once the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori is confirmed , treatment requires at least two antibiotics and an acid inhibitor for a minimum of seven days . BACKGROUND	Unfortunately , treatment failures are being frequently reported . BACKGROUND	Treatment regimens that include sequential administration of antibiotics with acid inhibitors have been developed to try and increase the rate of eradication . OBJECTIVE	To determine the effectiveness of a novel 10-day sequential therapy compared with the standard 10-day triple therapy for treatment of H. pylori infection in children . METHODS	A double-blinded , randomised , controlled trial was conducted . METHODS	Children under the age of 16 years with recurrent abdominal pain associated with dyspepsia and diagnosed with H. pylori by histology were randomly allocated either to a 10-day sequential treatment regimen or to a 10-day conventional triple therapy . METHODS	Analysis of the outcome of this study was based on clinical improvement and confirmed H. pylori eradication based on stool H. pylori antigen detection and/or repeat endoscopy . RESULTS	Of the 71 patients included in the analysis , 45 ( 63.4 % ) were given the 10-day conventional treatment while 26 ( 36.6 % ) received the 10-day sequential treatment . RESULTS	There was no difference in clinical improvement after treatment in the two therapies . RESULTS	However , there was a significant difference in the eradication of H. pylori between the conventional v. sequential regimens ( 48.8 % v. 84.6 % , respectively ; p = 0.02 , odds ratio 0.19 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The sequential treatment had a significantly higher H. pylori eradication rate than the conventional treatment ."
"OBJECTIVE	To examine the effect of supplementation with probiotics on respiratory and gastrointestinal illness in healthy active men and women . METHODS	A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted . METHODS	Four hundred and sixty five participants ( 241 males ; age 35 12 y ( mean SD ) and 224 females ; age 36 12 y ) were assigned to one of three groups : Group 1 - Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . METHODS	lactis Bl-04 ( Bl-04 ) 2.0 10 ( 9 ) colony forming units per day , CFU per day , Group 2 - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . METHODS	lactis Bi-07 ( NCFM & Bi-07 ) 5 10 ( 9 ) CFU each per day ) or Group 3 - placebo mixed in a drink . RESULTS	The risk of an upper respiratory illness episode was significantly lower in the Bl-04 group ( hazard ratio 0.73 ; 95 % confidence interval 0.55-0 .95 ; P = 0.022 ) compared to placebo . RESULTS	There was no significant difference in illness risk between the NCFM & Bi-07 group ( hazard ratio 0.81 ; 0.62-1 .08 ; P = 0.15 ) and the placebo group . RESULTS	There was a 0.7 and 0.9 month delay in the median time to an illness episode in the Bl-04 and NCFM & Bi-07 groups respectively compared to placebo ( placebo 2.5 months ; Bl-04 3.2 months ; NCFM & Bi-07 3.4 months ) . RESULTS	There were insufficient GI illness episodes for analysis . RESULTS	The NCFM & Bi-07 group but not the Bl-04 group undertook significantly more physical activity ( 8.5 % ; 6.7 % -10 % ; P < 0.003 ) than the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	The probiotic Bl-04 appears to be a useful nutritional supplement in reducing the risk of URTI in healthy physically-active adults .

"OBJECTIVE	Based on a radiobiological assumption of a low alpha/beta ( / ) ratio for prostate cancer , hypofractionated radiotherapy has increasingly gained traction in the clinical practice and recent guidelines have confirmed the non-inferiority of this approach . OBJECTIVE	Nevertheless , the largest studies that have used hypofractionation so far , employed image-guided radiation therapy/intensity modulated radiation therapy ( IGRT/IMRT ) facilities that might have overcome the radiobiological advantages , which remain to be fully confirmed . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this trial was to evaluate the feasibility of a hypofractionated schedule delivered with 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy to prostate and seminal vesicles in combination with hormonal therapy . METHODS	The study included 97 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer ( PCa ) , irrespective of risk class , treated with a schedule of 62 Gy in 20 fractions over 5 weeks ( 4 fractions of 3.1 Gy each per week ) . METHODS	According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) prognostic classification , patients were divided into a favourable group ( 19 % ) , intermediate group ( 41 % ) and unfavourable group ( 40 % ) . METHODS	Early and late toxicities were scored using the radiation toxicity grading/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( RTOG/EORTC ) criteria . METHODS	Additionally , the international prostate symptom index ( IPSS ) for benign prostate hypertrophy was used to evaluate obstructive urinary symptoms . METHODS	Biochemical outcome was reported according to the Phoenix definition for biochemical failure . METHODS	Hormonal therapy ( HT ) was administrated in 92 % of patients . RESULTS	After a median follow-up of 39 months ( range = 25-52 ) , maximum G2 late genitourinary ( GU ) and gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicities occurred in 8 % and 11 % patients , respectively . RESULTS	The corresponding figures for acute toxicities were 24 % and 15 % . RESULTS	Patients with higher IPSS score before enrolment had significantly worse urinary function after treatment . RESULTS	Only 2 % of patients died from PCa . RESULTS	Biochemical non-evidence of disease ( bNED ) was 83 % for all patients . CONCLUSIONS	Our study confirms that 3D conformal radiotherapy ( 3DCRT ) remains a safe and effective method to deliver a dose-escalated hypofractionated regimen for PCa patients in all risk classes with acceptable toxicity rates and optimal biochemical control ."
"BACKGROUND	The study aimed to determine the effect of preference-based tailored navigation on colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening adherence and related outcomes among African Americans ( AAs ) . METHODS	We conducted a randomized controlled trial that included 764 AA patients who were age 50 to 75 years , were eligible for CRC screening , and had received care through primary care practices in Philadelphia . METHODS	Consented patients completed a baseline telephone survey and were randomized to either a Standard Intervention ( SI ) group ( n = 380 ) or a Tailored Navigation Intervention ( TNI ) group ( n = 384 ) . METHODS	The SI group received a mailed stool blood test kit plus colonoscopy instructions , and a reminder . METHODS	The TNI group received tailored navigation ( a mailed stool blood test kit or colonoscopy instructions based on preference , plus telephone navigation ) and a reminder . METHODS	A six-month survey and a 12-month medical records review were completed to assess screening adherence , change in overall screening preference , and perceptions about screening . METHODS	Multivariable analyses were performed to assess intervention impact on outcomes . RESULTS	At six months , adherence in the TNI group was statistically significantly higher than in the SI group ( OR = 2.1 , 95 % CI = 1.5 to 2.9 ) . RESULTS	Positive change in overall screening preference was also statistically significantly greater in the TNI group compared with the SI group ( OR = 1.5 , 95 % CI = 1.0 to 2.3 ) . RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in perceptions about screening between the study groups . CONCLUSIONS	Tailored navigation in primary care is a promising approach for increasing CRC screening among AAs . CONCLUSIONS	Research is needed to determine how to maximize intervention effects and to test intervention impact on race-related disparities in mortality and survival ."
"OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine the effects of synbiotic food consumption on glycemic status and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) levels of Iranian pregnant women . METHODS	This randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed among 52 pregnant women , primigravida , aged 18-35 year old , in their third trimester . METHODS	After a 2-wk run-in period , subjects were randomly assigned to consume either a synbiotic ( n = 26 ) or control food ( n = 26 ) for 9 weeks . METHODS	The synbiotic food consisted of a probiotic Lactobacillus sporogenes ( 1107 CFU ) , 0.04 g inulin as prebiotic with 0.38 g isomalt , 0.36 g sorbitol and 0.05 g stevia as sweetener per 1 g. Control food ( the same substance without probiotic bacteria and inulin ) was packed in identical 9-gram packages . METHODS	Patients were asked to consume the synbiotic and control foods two times a day . METHODS	Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after a 9-wk intervention for quantification of related factors . RESULTS	Consumption of a synbiotic food did not show any significant change regarding the impact of insulin actions in the synbiotic group ; nonetheless , compared to the control food , it resulted in a significant decrease in serum insulin levels ( -0.26 vs. 6.34 IU/mL , P = 0.014 ) and HOMA-IR ( -0.13 vs. 1.13 , P = 0.033 ) , a significant difference in HOMA-B ( 5.30 vs. 34.22 , P = 0.040 ) and a significant rise in QUICKI score ( 0.002 vs. -0.02 , P = 0.022 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of a synbiotic food for 9 weeks by pregnant women had beneficial effects on insulin actions compared to the control food , but did not affect FPG and serum hs-CRP concentrations ."
"BACKGROUND	The burden of acute gastroenteritis on children and their families continues to be enormous . BACKGROUND	Probiotics , defined as viable microbial preparations that have a beneficial effect on the health of the host , represent a rapidly expanding field . BACKGROUND	Although clinical trials in children with gastroenteritis have been performed , most have significant flaws , and guidelines do not consistently endorse their use . METHODS	PROGUT is a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , five-center , Canadian , emergency department trial . METHODS	Children aged 3months to 48months who present between November 2013 and June 2017 with < 72hours of gastroenteritis symptoms will be assessed for eligibility . METHODS	A total of 886 children will be randomized ( 1:1 allocation via an internet based , third party , randomization service ) to receive 5days of a combination probiotic agent ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. helveticus ) or placebo . METHODS	All participants , caregivers , and outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment . METHODS	The study includes three key outcomes : 1 ) clinical - the development of moderate to severe disease following an emergency department ( ED ) evaluation that employs a validated clinical score ( Modified Vesikari Scale ) ; 2 ) safety - side effect ; and 3 ) mechanism - fecal secretory immunoglobulin A levels . CONCLUSIONS	Definitive data are lacking to guide the clinical use of probiotics in children with acute gastroenteritis . CONCLUSIONS	Hence , probiotics are rarely prescribed by North American physicians . CONCLUSIONS	However , the following current trends obligate an urgent assessment : 1 ) probiotics are sold as food supplements , and manufacturers can encourage their use while their relevance has yet to be established ; 2 ) North American and European government agencies remain concerned about their value and safety ; 3 ) some institutions are now recommending the routine use of probiotics ; and 4 ) parents of affected children are often providing probiotics . CONCLUSIONS	With probiotic consumption increasing in the absence of solid evidence , there is a need to conduct this definitive trial to overcome the limitations of prior work in this field . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT01853124 ; first registered 9 May 2013 ."
"BACKGROUND	We have already reported that , for patients undergoing elective colon cancer operations , perioperative infection can be prevented by a single intravenous dose of an antibiotic given immediately beforehand if mechanical bowel preparation and the administration of oral antibiotics are implemented . BACKGROUND	Synbiotics has been reported to reduce the rate of infection in patients after pancreatic cancer operations . BACKGROUND	The effectiveness of oral antibiotics and probiotics in preventing postoperative infection in elective colon cancer procedures was examined in a randomized controlled trial . METHODS	Three hundred ten patients with colon cancer randomly were assigned to one of three groups . METHODS	All patients underwent mechanical bowel preparation and received a single intravenous dose of flomoxef immediately before operation . METHODS	Probiotics were administered in Group A ; oral antibiotics were administered in Group B ; and neither probiotics nor oral antibiotics were administered in Group C. Stool samples were collected 9 and 2 days before and 7 and 14 days after the procedure . METHODS	Clostridium difficile toxin and the number of bacteria in the intestine were determined . RESULTS	The rates of incisional surgical-site infection were 18.0 % , 6.1 % , and 17.9 % in Groups A , B , and C , and the rates of leakage were 12.0 % , 1.0 % , and 7.4 % in Groups A , B , and C , respectively , indicating that both rates were lesser in Group B than in Groups A and C ( P = .014 and P = .004 , respectively ) . RESULTS	The detection rates of C. difficile toxin were not changed among the three groups . CONCLUSIONS	We recommend oral antibiotics , rather than probiotics , as bowel preparation for elective colon cancer procedures to prevent surgical-site infections ."
"OBJECTIVE	Orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque , with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances . METHODS	Twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into the study . METHODS	Each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth . METHODS	All patients received self-ligating brackets , but again using randomization , one upper lateral incisor bracket ( left or right ) also received an elastomeric ligature . METHODS	Plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal . METHODS	Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rDNA microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints . RESULTS	Plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites . RESULTS	The greatest differences in plaque composition were seen with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature . RESULTS	Post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis , Tannerella forsythia , and Eubacterium nodatum , while Campylobacter rectus , Parvimonas micra , and Actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds . CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential ."
"BACKGROUND	Chronic constipation is frequent in children . BACKGROUND	The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of PEG 4000 and lactulose for the treatment of chronic constipation in young children . METHODS	This randomised , double-blind study enrolled 88 young children aged 12 to 36 months , who were randomly assigned to receive lactulose ( 3.3 g per day ) or PEG 4000 ( 8 g per day ) for four weeks . METHODS	The primary efficacy variable was stool frequency during the fourth week of treatment . METHODS	Secondary outcomes were the number and frequency of subjective symptoms associated with defecation at each visit . RESULTS	Stool frequency was comparable in the two groups at baseline ( lactulose : 0.7 0.5 ; PEG 4000 : 0.5 0.55 ) . RESULTS	Mean stool frequency increased from 0.70 0.50 stools/day at baseline to 0.80 0.41 at Week 4 in the lactulose group and from 0.50 0.55 to 1.10 0.55 stools/day in the PEG 4000 group . RESULTS	A significant difference was observed in the adjusted mean change from baseline , which was 0.15 stools/day in the lactulose group and 0.51 stools/day in the PEG 4000 group , with a least-squares mean difference of 0.36 stools/day [ 95 % CI : 0.16 to 0.56 ] . RESULTS	With respect to secondary outcome variables , stool consistency and ease of stool passage improved more in the PEG 4000 group ( p = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups , the majority of which were mild . CONCLUSIONS	PEG 4000 has superior efficacy to lactulose for the treatment of chronic constipation in young children and is well tolerated .

"OBJECTIVE	The risk of urinary tract infection ( UTI ) among women undergoing elective gynecological surgery during which a catheter is placed is high : 10-64 % following catheter removal . OBJECTIVE	We conducted the first randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of the therapeutic efficacy of cranberry juice capsules in preventing UTI after surgery . METHODS	We recruited patients from a single hospital between August 2011 and January 2013 . METHODS	Eligible participants were undergoing elective gynecological surgery that did not involve a fistula repair or vaginal mesh removal . METHODS	One hundred sixty patients were randomized and received 2 cranberry juice capsules 2 times a day , equivalent to 2 8 ounce servings of cranberry juice , for 6 weeks after surgery or matching placebo . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who experienced clinically diagnosed and treated UTI with or without positive urine culture . METHODS	Kaplan-Meier plots and log rank tests compared the 2 treatment groups . RESULTS	The occurrence of UTI was significantly lower in the cranberry treatment group compared with the placebo group ( 15 of 80 [ 19 % ] vs 30 of 80 [ 38 % ] ; odds ratio , 0.38 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.19-0 .79 ; P = .008 ) . RESULTS	After adjustment for known confounders , including the frequency of intermittent self-catheterization in the postoperative period , the protective effects of cranberry remained ( odds ratio , 0.42 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.18-0 .94 ) . RESULTS	There were no treatment differences in the incidence of adverse events , including gastrointestinal upset ( 56 % vs 61 % for cranberry vs placebo ) . CONCLUSIONS	Among women undergoing elective benign gynecological surgery involving urinary catheterization , the use of cranberry extract capsules during the postoperative period reduced the rate of UTI by half ."
"BACKGROUND	Postoperative ileus is the most common complication after ileostomy closure with an increase in morbidity , hospital stay , and health care costs . OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to assess the utility of a new technique for reducing postoperative ileus after protective ileostomy closure . METHODS	This is a prospective randomized study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01881594 ) . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo either stimulation through the efferent limb of the ileostomy before surgery or nonstimulation before surgery . METHODS	This study was conducted at the Department of Surgery of the Virgen de la Arrixaca Clinical University Hospital ( Murcia ) . METHODS	Seventy patients underwent surgery for ileostomy closure . METHODS	In 35 patients , during the 2 weeks before surgery , daily stimulation of the defunctionalized stomal segment was performed by using a thick solution ( 500 mL of physiological saline associated with 30 g of thickening agent , Nestle Resource , Vevey , Switzerland ) . METHODS	In the other 35 patients , stimulation was not performed before surgery . METHODS	The primary outcome was postoperative ileus . METHODS	The secondary outcomes included time to tolerating a diet and postoperative stay . RESULTS	Both groups of patients were homogenous for demographic data , characteristics of the first rectal cancer operation , and intersurgery periods . RESULTS	After ileostomy closure , the stimulated group of patients had an earlier return to oral tolerance ( 1.06 vs 2.57 days ; p = 0.007 ) and passage of flatus or stool ( 1.14 vs 2.85 days ; p < 0.001 ) than the nonstimulated group of patients . RESULTS	The incidence of postoperative ileus ( 2.85 % vs 20 % ; p = 0.024 ) and hospital stay ( 2.49 vs 4.61 days ; p = 0.002 ) was also lower in the stimulated patients . CONCLUSIONS	Small numbers of patients means that no definitive statements can be made regarding the effectiveness of this technique . CONCLUSIONS	Stimulation of the efferent limb of the ileostomy before closure is a safe technique that reduces postoperative ileus and fosters early intestinal transit and oral tolerance with a shorter postoperative hospital stay ."
"BACKGROUND	Physical fitness is a fundamental prerequisite for soccer players . BACKGROUND	Kaempferia parviflora is an herbal plant that has been used in some Asian athletes with the belief that it might prevent fatigue and improve physical fitness . BACKGROUND	This study aimed to determine the effects of Kaempferia parviflora on the physical fitness of soccer players . METHODS	Sixty soccer players who routinely trained at a sports school participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial and were randomly allocated to the treatment group or the placebo group . METHODS	The participants in both groups were given either 180 mg of Kaempferia parviflora extract in capsules or a placebo once daily for 12 weeks . METHODS	Baseline data were collected using the following 6 tests of physical performance : a sit-and-reach test , a hand grip strength test , a back-and-leg strength test , a 40-yard technical test , a 50-metre sprint test , and a cardiorespiratory fitness test . METHODS	All of the tests were performed every 4 weeks throughout the 12-week study period . RESULTS	The study showed that after treatment with Kaempferia parviflora , the right-hand grip strength was significantly increased at weeks 4 , 8 , and 12 . RESULTS	The left-hand grip strength was significantly increased at week 8 . RESULTS	However , the back-and-leg strength , the 40-yard technical test , the sit-and-reach test , the 50-metre sprint test , and the cardiorespiratory fitness test results of the treatment group were not significantly different from those of the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	Taking Kaempferia parviflora supplements for 12 weeks may significantly enhance some physical fitness components in soccer players ."
"BACKGROUND	Laparoscopic adhesiolysis is emerging as an alternative for open surgery in adhesive small bowel obstruction . BACKGROUND	Retrospective studies suggest that laparoscopic approach shortens hospital stay and reduces complications in these patients . BACKGROUND	However , no prospective , randomized , controlled trials comparing laparoscopy to open surgery have been published . METHODS	This is a multicenter , prospective , open label , randomized , controlled trial comparing laparoscopic adhesiolysis to open surgery in patients with computed-tomography diagnosed adhesive small bowel obstruction that is not resolving with conservative management . METHODS	The primary study endpoint is the length of postoperative hospital stay in days.Sample size was estimated based on preliminary retrospective cohort , which suggested that 102 patients would provide 80 % power to detect a difference of 2.5 days in the length of postoperative hospital stay with significance level of 0.05 . METHODS	Secondary endpoints include passage of stool , commencement of enteral nutrition , 30-day mortality , complications , postoperative pain , and the length of sick leave . METHODS	Tertiary endpoints consist of the rate of ventral hernia and the recurrence of small bowel obstruction during long-term follow-up . METHODS	Long-term follow-up by letter or telephone interview will take place at 1 , 5 , and 10 years . CONCLUSIONS	To the best of our knowledge , this trial is the first one aiming to provide level Ib evidence to assess the use of laparoscopy in the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction .

"OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic containing Bacillus toyonensis spores ( Toyocerin ( ) ) in postweaning piglets against enteric pathogens . RESULTS	Seven hundred and ninety-two healthy weaning pigs of a commercial farrow-to-finish pig farm were used . RESULTS	The negative control group fed without Toyocerin ( ) and two experimental groups fed similar to the negative control group , but supplemented with Toyocerin ( ) at t 500 mg kg ( -1 ) diet ( Toyocerin 500 group ) and 1000 mg kg ( -1 ) diet ( Toyocerin 1000 group ) , respectively . RESULTS	No significant difference ( P > 0.05 ) in morbidity and mortality rate between groups was noticed . RESULTS	The Toyocerin groups showed higher body weight ( P < 0.05 ) and lower feed conversion ratio compared to the negative control group . RESULTS	Diarrhoea score was less in both Toyocerin groups than negative control group ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Moreover , the use of Toyocerin ( ) at 1000 mg kg ( -1 ) diet resulted in higher average daily feed intake compared to other groups ( P < 0.05 ) , reduction of some enteric pathogens and increase of the number of lactic acid bacteria . CONCLUSIONS	The use of Toyocerin ( ) in weaning pigs , especially at 1000 mg kg ( -1 ) diet , improved their health and growth performance . CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that a feed additive containing B. toyonensis ( Toyocerin ( ) ) protects against enteric pathogens in postweaning piglets when fed this additive at a proper dose . CONCLUSIONS	The use of Toyocerin ( ) at 1000 mg kg ( -1 ) diet resulted in higher average daily feed intake , decrease of some enteric pathogens and higher number of lactic acid bacteria . CONCLUSIONS	The effect of the probiotic in other age groups remains to be established ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effectiveness , safety and tolerability of a probiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium BB-12 in the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhoea ( AAD ) . METHODS	A double-blind randomised placebo controlled multicentric trial was conducted in adults who were prescribed a seven-day course of oral antibiotic ( either cefadroxil or amoxycillin ) for a documented indication . METHODS	The effectiveness of a 14-day therapy ( concomitant with antibiotic course and seven days thereafter ) of the probiotic formulation in preventing AAD was evaluated . METHODS	Safety profile was assessed by monitoring of all treatment emergent adverse events and tolerability on a global well being scale . RESULTS	The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 10.8 % compared to 15.6 % in the placebo group , the difference being statistically non-significant ( p = 0.19 ) . RESULTS	The relative risk for AAD was 0.7 with the 95 % CI being 0.4 to 1.2 . RESULTS	The diarrhoea duration in the probiotic group was two days with an interquartile range of 1 - 3 days and was significantly less ( p = 0.01 ) than the placebo group which was four days with an interquartile range of 3 - 5.5 days . RESULTS	Subgroup analysis of subjects with AAD showed that the incidence of severe diarrhoea ( watery stools ) was 96 % in the placebo group ( 25 out of 26 ) compared to 31.6 % ( 6 out of 19 ) in the probiotic group and this difference was significant statistically ( p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Four mild , non-serious , adverse events were detected ( 2.0 % ) in the probiotic group but there were none in the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS	This randomised controlled trial shows that prophylactic administration of the probiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium BB-12 , did not effectively lower the incidence of AAD in adults . CONCLUSIONS	However , compared to placebo the duration of diarrhoea in the probiotic group was significantly reduced . CONCLUSIONS	Its tolerability and safety profile were good ."
"OBJECTIVE	Bile acid malabsorption ( BAM ) - associated diarrhea is an important clinical issue in patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . OBJECTIVE	We analyzed the efficacy and safety of the bile acid sequestrant colesevelam for treatment of BAM-associated diarrhea in CD patients in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . METHODS	The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with > 30 % reduction of liquid stools/day from baseline to termination visit at week 4 . METHODS	Secondary endpoints were reduction of the number of liquid stools/day , improvement of stool consistency and quality of life . RESULTS	26 patients were analyzed in the intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis . RESULTS	The primary endpoint was reached by 10 patients ( 69.7 % ) in the colesevelam group compared to 3 patients ( 27.3 % ) in the placebo group ( risk difference RD = .394 , 95 % CI :[ -0.012 ; 0.706 ] ; P = .0566 ) . RESULTS	In the per-protocol analysis ( n = 22 ) , the risk difference was statistically significant ( RD = .470 , 95 % CI : [ 0.018 ; 0.788 ] , P ( H0 : RD = 0 ) = 0.0364 ; 95 % CI : [ 1.3 ; 54.7 ] ) . RESULTS	Regarding secondary endpoints , in the ITT population colesevelam-treated patients had a significant reduction of liquid stools/day at week 4 ( median 5.0 to 2.0 ; P = 0.01 ) , while patients treated with placebo had no significant reduction ( median 4.0 to 3.0 ; P = 0.42 ) . RESULTS	Significantly more patients in the colesevelam group had improvement of stool consistency of at least one level in the Bristol stool chart , as compared to the placebo group ( P = 0.003 ) . CONCLUSIONS	We found significant differences in favor for colesevelam treatment compared to placebo treatment for CD patients with BAM regarding the reduction of the number of liquid stools/day and stool consistency .

"OBJECTIVE	Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease in which the gut microbiota is altered . OBJECTIVE	Probiotics are microorganisms that can normalize gut microbiota ; thus , they may help to alleviate RA symptoms . OBJECTIVE	The objective of the present clinical trial was to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on disease activity and inflammatory cytokines in patients with RA . METHODS	Forty-six patients with RA were assigned into two groups in this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . METHODS	The patients in the probiotic group received a daily capsule that contained a minimum of 10 ( 8 ) colony-forming units of Lactobacillus casei 01 for 8 wk . METHODS	The placebo group took capsules filled with maltodextrin for the same time period . METHODS	Questionnaires , anthropometric measurements , and fasting blood samples were collected , and the participants were assessed by a rheumatologist at baseline and at the end of the trial . RESULTS	Disease activity score was significantly decreased by the intervention , and there was a significant difference between the two groups at the end of the study ( P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Three of the assessed serum proinflammatory cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor - , interleukin-6 , and interleukin-12 ) significantly decreased in the probiotic group ( P < 0.05 ) ; however , serum levels of interleukin-1 were not significantly affected by the probiotic ( P = 0.22 ) . RESULTS	The serum level of regulatory cytokine ( interleukin-10 ) was increased by the supplementation ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	The proportion of interleukin-10 to interleukin-12 was significantly increased in the probiotic group as well . CONCLUSIONS	L. casei 01 supplementation improved the disease activity and inflammatory status of patients with RA . CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted to confirm these results , and such confirmation may lead to the introduction of probiotics as adjunctive therapy for this population ."
"OBJECTIVE	Intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . OBJECTIVE	Administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations . OBJECTIVE	We investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with CF and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation . OBJECTIVE	We also investigated the microflora structure before and after Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) administration in children with CF with and without antibiotic treatment . METHODS	The intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) , real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . METHODS	Intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin ( CLP ) and rectal nitric oxide ( rNO ) production in children with CF as compared with healthy controls . METHODS	We then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with LGG . RESULTS	Twenty-two children with CF children were enrolled in the study ( median age , 7 years ; range , 2-9 years ) . RESULTS	Fecal CLP and rNO levels were higher in children with CF than in healthy controls ( 184146 g/g vs. 5246 g/g ; 1815 vs. 2.61.2 mol/L NO2 ( - ) , respectively ; P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Compared with healthy controls , children with CF had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures . RESULTS	The levels of Eubacterium rectale , Bacteroides uniformis , Bacteroides vulgatus , Bifidobacterium adolescentis , Bifidobacterium catenulatum , and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with CF. A similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with CF who were taking antibiotics . RESULTS	LGG administration reduced fecal CLP and partially restored intestinal microbiota . RESULTS	There was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation . CONCLUSIONS	CF causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota , which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of CF. Administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota , supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 01961661 ."

METHODS	The study included men and women 18-65 y.o. METHODS	They have been devided in to 2 group by randomized choice ( 20 patients in each group ) . METHODS	Patients were treated with the reinforced H. pylori eradication therapy : PPI ( 40 mg , / q12h ) , clarithromycin ( 500mg/q12h ) , amoxicillin ( 1000 mg/q12h ) , bismuth subcitrate ( 240 mg/q12h ) for 10 days . METHODS	The first group given bismuth subcitrate -- De-Nol , the second group given Novobismol . METHODS	Eradication was confirmed by a 13C-urea breath test and monoclonal stool antigen test 6-8 weeks after therapy . RESULTS	A total of 34 patients underwent eradication treatment . RESULTS	Two were lost to follow-up ( one patient in each group ) , four patients ( two patients in each group ) did not complete treatment due to adverse events . RESULTS	The eradication rates were 97.1 % ( 95 % CI , 88.9 % -100.0 % ) by per-protocol ( PP ) and 82.5 % ( 95 % CI , 69.4 % - 92.5 % ) by intention-to-treat ( ITT ) in the two groups . RESULTS	The ITT analyses resulted in rates of 85 % ( 95 % CI , 66.5-96 .9 ) for the 10-d reinforced therapy with DeNol and was 80 % ( 95 % CI : 60.2-94 .1 ) for the 10-d reinforced therapy with Novobismol ( P = 0.68 ) , while the PP analyses resulted in 100 % ( 95 % CI , 94.5-100 .0 ) and 94.1 % ( 95 % CI : 78.3-99 .9 ) , respectively ( P = 0.31 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The reinforced H. pylori eradication therapy ( 10-day high-dose PPI bismuth-containing standard triple therapy ) achieves a significantly high eradication rates in patients with H. pylori - associated diseases . CONCLUSIONS	Both drugs ( De - Nol and Novobismol ) are both effective and safe for the first-line eradication of H. pylori ."
"BACKGROUND	Patients with subocclusive Crohn 's disease ( CD ) who received azathioprine ( AZA ) therapy had lower re-hospitalization rates due to all causes and for surgical management of CD compared to those treated with mesalazine during a 3-year period . BACKGROUND	We investigated whether AZA also was effective for prevention of recurrent bowel obstruction . METHODS	Rates of recurrent bowel occlusion were compared between patients treated with AZA and those treated with mesalazine . METHODS	We assessed the time interval-off intestinal obstruction as well as the occlusion-free survival for both groups . RESULTS	There was a significantly lower cumulative rate of patients with recurrent subocclusion in the AZA group ( 56 % ) compared with the mesalazine group ( 79 % ; OR 3.34 , 95 % CI 1.67-8 .6 ; P = 0.003 ) , with the number needed to treat in order to prevent 1 subocclusion episode of 3.7 favoring AZA . RESULTS	The occlusion-free time interval was longer in the AZA group compared with the mesalazine group ( 28.8 vs. 18.3 months ; P = 0.000 ) . RESULTS	The occlusion-free survival at 12 , 24 , and 36 months was significantly higher in the AZA group ( 91 % , 81 % , and 72 % , respectively ) than in the mesalazine group ( 64.7 % , 35.3 % , and 23.5 % , respectively ; P < 0.05 for all comparisons ) . CONCLUSIONS	In an exploratory analysis of patients with subocclusive ileocecal CD , maintenance therapy with AZA is more effective than mesalazine for eliminating or postponing recurrent intestinal obstruction during 3 years of therapy ."
"OBJECTIVE	This comparative study was aimed at determining the effectiveness of oral Misoprostol compared with intravenous Ergometrine and intravenous Oxytocin in reducing vaginal bleeding following surgical evacuation for first trimester abortions . METHODS	This was a single-blind placebo-controlled study in which patients with first trimester uncomplicated abortions were divided into three groups using computer-generated randomization table . METHODS	The first group was administered oral Misoprostol , the second group had intravenous Ergometrine , and the third group was administered intravenous Oxytocin . METHODS	The uterotonic agents were administered before the surgical evacuation was carried out . RESULTS	There was statistically significant reduction in blood loss after the evacuation in the Misoprostol group ( P < 0.000 ) . RESULTS	There was also significant reduction in the number of days of bleeding in the Misoprostol group ( 2.00 0.86 ) compared with 4.43 0.92 and 4.64 1.06 days in the Ergometrine and Oxytocin groups , respectively ( P < 0.000 ) . RESULTS	There were , however , more gastrointestinal side effects in the Misoprostol and Ergometrine groups ( 60.7 % and 57.1 % , respectively ) compared with the Oxytocin group . CONCLUSIONS	Oral Misoprostol appeared to demonstrate superior efficacy in reducing uterine bleeding after surgical evacuation , compared to the other commonly used uterotonic agents ."
"METHODS	There is a growing interest in food constituents that could reduce intestinal glucose absorption to prevent overshooting plasma glucose and insulin levels in patients with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus type 2 . RESULTS	We here demonstrate that an extract and individual polyphenols from apple diminish sodium-coupled glucose transporter 1 ( SGLT1 ) mediated glucose uptake in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS	Inhibition of transport of sugars by SGLT1 was shown in Xenopus oocytes and in mice jejunal segments . RESULTS	Strongest inhibition was observed for phlorizin with IC50 values for transport inhibition of 0.46 0.19 and 4.1 0.6 M in oocytes and intestinal segments , respectively . RESULTS	An oral glucose tolerance test performed in volunteers with prior administration of the apple extract reduced venous blood glucose and plasma insulin levels , similar to findings obtained in C57BL/6N mice . RESULTS	Analysis of human urine samples revealed that the extract increased modestly renal glucose loss that is most likely a result of inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption by phloretin derivatives found in plasma of the volunteers . CONCLUSIONS	Although the apple extract substantially decreased intestinal glucose absorption in all test systems , the finding that there are systemic effects that relate to inhibition of glucose transport processes beyond the intestine addresses safety issues that need further exploitation ."
"BACKGROUND	This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of daily consumption of synbiotic bread on the metabolic status of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . METHODS	This randomized , double-blind , controlled clinical trial was performed in 81 diabetic patients . METHODS	The subjects were randomly assigned to consumption of synbiotic ( n = 27 ) , probiotic ( n = 27 ) , or control bread ( n = 27 ) for 8 weeks 3 times a day in a 40-gram package . METHODS	The synbiotic bread contained Lactobacillus sporogenes ( 1 10 ( 8 ) CFU ) and 0.07 g inulin per 1 g. METHODS	The probiotic bread contained L. sporogenes ( 1 10 ( 8 ) CFU per 1 g ) . METHODS	Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after an 8-week intervention for quantification of related factors . RESULTS	Consumption of the synbiotic bread resulted in a significant reduction in serum insulin levels ( -3.2 5.4 vs. -0.3 3.4 and 0.6 4.7 IU/ml , respectively , p = 0.007 ) , homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance scores ( -1.5 2.7 vs. -0.2 1.6 and 0.4 3.5 , respectively , p = 0.03 ) , and homeostatic model assessment -- cell function ( -7.2 16.3 vs. -0.7 10.8 and 0.7 8.2 , respectively , p = 0.04 ) compared to the probiotic and control breads . RESULTS	We did not find any significant effect of synbiotic bread consumption on fasting plasma glucose , the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index , or serum hs-CRP levels compared to other breads . CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of the synbiotic bread among diabetic patients had beneficial effects on insulin metabolism ."
"OBJECTIVE	Little is known about the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot osteomyelitis ( DFO ) . OBJECTIVE	This study sought to compare the effectiveness of 6 versus 12 weeks of antibiotic therapy in patients with DFO treated nonsurgically ( i.e. , antibiotics alone ) . METHODS	This was a prospective randomized trial comparing 6 - versus 12-week duration of antibiotic treatment . METHODS	Remission of osteomyelitis during the monitoring period was defined as complete and persistent ( > 4 weeks ) healing of the wound ( if present initially ) , absence of recurrent infection at the initial site or that of adjacent rays , and no need for surgical bone resection or amputation at the end of a follow-up period of at least 12 months after completion of antibiotic treatment . RESULTS	Forty patients followed at five French general hospitals were randomized between January 2007 and January 2009 , with 20 treated for 6 weeks and 20 treated for 12 weeks with antibiotics . RESULTS	The two groups were comparable for all variables recorded at inclusion in the study . RESULTS	Remission was obtained in 26 ( 65 % ) patients , with no significant differences between patients treated for 6 versus 12 weeks ( 12/20 vs. 14/20 , respectively ; P = 0.50 ) . RESULTS	We did not identify any significant parameters associated with patient outcome . RESULTS	Fewer patients treated for 6 weeks experienced gastrointestinal adverse events related to antimicrobial therapy compared with patients treated for 12 weeks ( respectively , 15 vs. 45 % ; P = 0.04 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The present multicenter prospective randomized study provides data suggesting that 6-week duration of antibiotic therapy may be sufficient in patients with DFO for whom nonsurgical treatment is considered ."
"BACKGROUND	Viral upper respiratory tract infections occur frequently among conscripts . BACKGROUND	Probiotics have reduced viral infections in children attending day care . BACKGROUND	Limited data are available on the effects of probiotics on the nasopharyngeal presence of respiratory viruses . OBJECTIVE	To assess , whether probiotics could decrease nasopharyngeal occurrence of respiratory viruses in Finnish conscripts . METHODS	In a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled 90 - and 150-day intervention study , 239 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 192 symptomatic conscripts receiving daily chewable probiotic tablet containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp . METHODS	lactis BB-12 ( 46.9 % ) or control tablet ( 53.1 % ) on visits to a garrison 's health care center due to symptoms of infection . METHODS	The presence of respiratory viruses was tested by PCR-methods , and viral findings were compared between the intervention groups . RESULTS	184 ( 76.9 % ) nasopharyngeal samples were positive for at least one respiratory virus . RESULTS	Picornaviruses were the most common viruses and were detected in 155 ( 84.2 % ) of samples . RESULTS	Of these , 143 ( 92.3 % ) were rhinovirus-positive and 20 ( 12.9 % ) were enterovirus-positive . RESULTS	The control group had 83 ( 64 % ) and the probiotic group 72 ( 66 % ) picornavirus infections ( p = 0.79 ) . RESULTS	Monthly distribution of picornaviruses showed that there were less picornavirus findings after 3 months in the probiotic group than in the control group ( p = 0.0069 ) . RESULTS	However , probiotics did not reduce picornavirus occurrence in other months . CONCLUSIONS	Overall , probiotics did not reduce viral occurrence in symptomatic conscripts . CONCLUSIONS	However , probiotics decreased the presence of picornaviruses after 3 months , which may imply that probiotics play a role against viruses causing common cold . CONCLUSIONS	Further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved in order to target specific probiotics on specific respiratory viruses ."
"OBJECTIVE	To report late toxicity outcomes from a randomized trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated prostate radiation therapy and to identify dosimetric and clinical parameters associated with late toxicity after hypofractionated treatment . METHODS	Men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in a trial that randomized men to either conventionally fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy ( CIMRT , 75.6 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions ) or to dose-escalated hypofractionated IMRT ( HIMRT , 72 Gy in 2.4-Gy fractions ) . METHODS	Late ( 90 days after completion of radiation therapy ) genitourinary ( GU ) and gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity were prospectively evaluated and scored according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria . RESULTS	101 men received CIMRT and 102 men received HIMRT . RESULTS	The median age was 68 , and the median follow-up time was 6.0 years . RESULTS	Twenty-eight percent had low-risk , 71 % had intermediate-risk , and 1 % had high-risk disease . RESULTS	There was no difference in late GU toxicity in men treated with CIMRT and HIMRT . RESULTS	The actuarial 5-year grade 2 GU toxicity was 16.5 % after CIMRT and 15.8 % after HIMRT ( P = .97 ) . RESULTS	There was a nonsignificant numeric increase in late GI toxicity in men treated with HIMRT compared with men treated with CIMRT . RESULTS	The actuarial 5-year grade 2 GI toxicity was 5.1 % after CIMRT and 10.0 % after HIMRT ( P = .11 ) . RESULTS	In men receiving HIMRT , the proportion of rectum receiving 36.9 Gy , 46.2 Gy , 64.6 Gy , and 73.9 Gy was associated with the development of late GI toxicity ( P < .05 ) . RESULTS	The 5-year actuarial grade 2 GI toxicity was 27.3 % in men with R64 .6 Gy 20 % but only 6.0 % in men with R64 .6 Gy < 20 % ( P = .016 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Dose-escalated IMRT using a moderate hypofractionation regimen ( 72 Gy in 2.4-Gy fractions ) can be delivered safely with limited grade 2 or 3 late toxicity . CONCLUSIONS	Minimizing the proportion of rectum that receives moderate and high dose decreases the risk of late rectal toxicity after this hypofractionation regimen ."

"BACKGROUND	Somatostatin analogues are commonly used to treat symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors ; however , data on their antitumor effects are limited . METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multinational study of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide in patients with advanced , well-differentiated or moderately differentiated , nonfunctioning , somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 ( a tumor proliferation index [ on staining for the Ki-67 antigen ] of < 10 % ) and documented disease-progression status . METHODS	The tumors originated in the pancreas , midgut , or hindgut or were of unknown origin . METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreotide ( Autogel [ known in the United States as Depot ] , Ipsen ) at a dose of 120 mg ( 101 patients ) or placebo ( 103 patients ) once every 28 days for 96 weeks . METHODS	The primary end point was progression-free survival , defined as the time to disease progression ( according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , version 1.0 ) or death . METHODS	Secondary end points included overall survival , quality of life ( assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-GI . METHODS	NET21 ) , and safety . RESULTS	Most patients ( 96 % ) had no tumor progression in the 3 to 6 months before randomization , and 33 % had hepatic tumor volumes greater than 25 % . RESULTS	Lanreotide , as compared with placebo , was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival ( median not reached vs. median of 18.0 months , P < 0.001 by the stratified log-rank test ; hazard ratio for progression or death , 0.47 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.30 to 0.73 ) . RESULTS	The estimated rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 65.1 % ( 95 % CI , 54.0 to 74.1 ) in the lanreotide group and 33.0 % ( 95 % CI , 23.0 to 43.3 ) in the placebo group . RESULTS	The therapeutic effect in predefined subgroups was generally consistent with that in the overall population , with the exception of small subgroups in which confidence intervals were wide . RESULTS	There were no significant between-group differences in quality of life or overall survival . RESULTS	The most common treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea ( in 26 % of the patients in the lanreotide group and 9 % of those in the placebo group ) . CONCLUSIONS	Lanreotide was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 ( Ki-67 < 10 % ) .

"BACKGROUND	In a recent double-blinded clinical trial , the probiotic combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM ( L-NCFM ) and B-LBi07 reduced bloating symptoms in patients with functional bowel disorders ; an effect more evident in those who reported abdominal pain . BACKGROUND	In mice , L-NCFM but not B-LBi07 induced colonic mu-opioid receptor ( MOR ) and cannabinoid receptor 2 ( CB2 ) expression , and reduced visceral sensitivity . OBJECTIVE	To determine if L-NCFM was the active component in the clinical trial and to investigate the mechanism of action in humans with mild to moderate abdominal pain . METHODS	Caucasian women ( n = 20 ) 18-70 years with mild to moderate abdominal pain were enrolled in a double-blind , two-armed , single-centre study . METHODS	Patients were given either L-NCFM alone or in combination with B-LBi07 for 21 days at a total dose of 2 10 ( 10 ) CFU b.d. Colonic biopsies were collected during unsedated , unprepped flexible sigmoidoscopy before and at the end of probiotic consumption . METHODS	mRNA and immunostaining were then performed on these biopsies . METHODS	Patients kept symptom diaries for the 7 days prior to starting probiotic therapy and for the last 7 days of therapy . RESULTS	L-NCFM alone , but not with B-LBi07 , induced colonic MOR mRNA and protein expression , as well as downstream signalling , as measured by enterocyte STAT3-phosphorylation . RESULTS	In contrast , CB2 expression was decreased . RESULTS	Both treatment groups trended towards improvement in symptoms , but the study was insufficiently powered to draw meaningful conclusions . CONCLUSIONS	Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM modulates mu-opioid receptor expression and activity , while the combination of L-NCFM and B-LBi07 does not . CONCLUSIONS	This study provides a possible mechanism for action by which probiotics modulates pain sensation in humans ( Clinical Trial Number : NCT01064661 ) ."
"BACKGROUND	Colonoscopy is the most frequent exam used to evaluate colonic mucosa , allowing the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases . BACKGROUND	The appropriate bowel preparation is indispensable for the realization of colonoscopy . BACKGROUND	Therefore , it is necessary the use of laxative medications , preferentially by oral administration . OBJECTIVE	To compare two medications used in bowel preparation in adult patients going to ambulatory colonoscopy and to analyze the patients ' profile . METHODS	A double-blind prospective study with 200 patients , randomized in two groups : one that received polyethilene glycol and another that received lactulose . METHODS	The patients answered to questionnaires to data compilation , as tolerance , symptoms and complications related to preparation . METHODS	Besides , it was also evaluated the prepare efficacy related to the presence of fecal residue . RESULTS	Intestinal habit alterations and abdominal pain were the main reasons to realize the exams and hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity . RESULTS	Ten percent of the ones who received lactulose did n't get to finish the preparation and 50 % considered the taste `` bad , but tolerable '' . RESULTS	The most common subjective symptom after the medication was nausea , especially after lactulose . RESULTS	During the exam , most of the patients who used lactulose had a `` light discomfort '' and the ones who used polyethilene glycol considered the discomfort as `` tolerable '' . RESULTS	The quality of the preparation was good in 75 % , undependable of the medication that was used . CONCLUSIONS	Polyethilene glycol was more tolerable when compared to lactulose , without difference on the quality of the preparation ."
"BACKGROUND	The Maastricht , Asia-Pacific consensus guidelines strongly recommend eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients who have a history of gastric cancer . BACKGROUND	This open-label , single-center , randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the appropriate timing of eradication for patients undergoing gastrectomy . METHODS	One hundred and fifty patients scheduled to undergo gastrectomy were allocated to either a preoperative or a postoperative group . METHODS	The eradication regimen was a common triple therapy : lansoprazole , amoxicillin , and clarithromycin . METHODS	Patients in the preoperative group were treated with the regimen , followed by surgery , and patients in the postoperative group were treated after postoperative day 8 . METHODS	The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving successful eradication in the remnant stomach . METHODS	The definition of successful eradication was negativity in both the C13 urea breath test and for the antigen in feces at 6 months after surgery . RESULTS	Eight patients were excluded , and the remaining one hundred and forty-two , 70 in the preoperative group and 72 in the postoperative group , were included on an intention to treat basis . RESULTS	The procedures used were gastrectomy with Billroth I , Roux-en-Y , and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy in 18 , 70 , and 57 patients , respectively . RESULTS	The proportion of patients showing successful eradication hardly differed between the 2 groups , 68.6 % vs 69.4 % ( p = 1.000 ) in the pre - and postoperative groups , respectively . RESULTS	Subgroup analysis also demonstrated no significant difference among the reconstruction methods used . CONCLUSIONS	Preoperative H pylori eradication therapy for gastric cancer patients scheduled for gastrectomy is not necessary , regardless of the planned reconstruction procedure ."
"BACKGROUND	Gastrointestinal ( GI ) discomfort , e.g. bloating or rumbling , is a common symptom in otherwise healthy adults . BACKGROUND	Approximately 20 % of the population , particularly women suffer from gastrointestinal discomfort and this affects quality of life . BACKGROUND	Recent studies discovered a link between the body and mind , called the gut-brain axis . BACKGROUND	Psychosocial factors , such as e.g. daily stress may cause altered gut physiology leading to ileum contractions and consequently gastrointestinal symptoms . BACKGROUND	In vitro and ex vivo studies clearly showed that a Perilla frutescens extract combines prokinetic , antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory effects . BACKGROUND	The aim of the intervention was to investigate the effects of the proprietary Perilla extract on GI discomfort in healthy subjects with gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced bowel movements in comparison to a placebo product . METHODS	The pilot study was performed according to a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled parallel design . METHODS	Fifty healthy subjects with gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced bowel movements , 30-70 years , documented their GI symptoms , stool frequency and consistency daily during a 2-week run-in phase and a 4-week intervention phase with Perilla frutescens extract or placebo . METHODS	GI symptoms were assessed on a 5-point scale daily and average scores over 14 days intervals were calculated . RESULTS	All GI symptoms were significantly improved over time by Perilla frutescens extract during the intervention phase ( bloating : -0.440.56 , p = 0.0003 ; passage of gas : -0.300.66 , p = 0.0264 ; GI rumbling : -0.550.87 , p = 0.0014 ; feeling of fullness : -0.360.72 , p = 0.0152 ; abdominal discomfort : -0.540.75 , p = 0.004 ) , whereas in the placebo group only abdominal discomfort was significantly improved ( -0.310.55 , p = 0.0345 ) . RESULTS	In the subgroup of women results were strengthened and a subscore out of bloating and abdominal discomfort was significantly improved against placebo ( 95 % CI 0.003 to 0.77 ; p = 0.048 ) . CONCLUSIONS	The demonstrated effects of Perilla frutescens extract to improve GI complaints offer very promising results , taking into consideration the challenging set up of a nutritional human study with healthy subjects and in the area of digestive health , which is known for high placebo effects .

"BACKGROUND	It is estimated that about 275,000 inhabitants experience an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) every year in Europe . BACKGROUND	Survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is relatively low , generally between five per cent and 10 % . BACKGROUND	Being able to explore new methods to improve the relatively low survival rate is vital for people with these conditions . BACKGROUND	Passive leg raise ( PLR ) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) has been found to improve cardiac preload and blood flow during chest compressions . BACKGROUND	The aim of our study is to evaluate whether early PLR during CPR also has an impact on one-month survival in sudden and unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) . METHODS	A prospective , randomized , controlled trial in which all patients ( 18years ) receiving out-of hospital CPR are randomized by envelope to be treated with either PLR or in the flat position . METHODS	The ambulance crew use a special folding stool which allows the legs to be elevated about 20 degrees . METHODS	Primary end-point : survival to one month . METHODS	Secondary end-point : survival to hospital admission to one month and to one year with acceptable cerebral performance classification ( CPC ) 1-2 . CONCLUSIONS	PLR is a simple and fast maneuver . CONCLUSIONS	We believe that the greatest benefit with PLR is when performed early in the process , during the first minutes of CPR and before the first defibrillation . CONCLUSIONS	To reach power this study need 3000 patients , we hope that this method article will encourage other sites to contact us and take part in our study .

"BACKGROUND	Little is known about the factors that predict for gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) recurrence in patients treated with adjuvant imatinib . METHODS	Risk factors for GIST recurrence were identified , and 2 risk stratification scores were developed using the database of the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group ( SSG ) XVIII trial , where 358 patients with high-risk GIST with no overt metastases were randomly assigned to adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day either for 12 or 36 months after surgery . METHODS	The findings were validated in the imatinib arm of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z9001 trial , where 359 patients with GIST were randomized to receive imatinib and 354 were to receive placebo for 12 months . RESULTS	Five factors ( high tumor mitotic count , nongastric location , large size , rupture , and adjuvant imatinib for 12 months ) were independently associated with unfavorable recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) in a multivariable analysis in the SSGXVIII cohort . RESULTS	A risk score based on these 5 factors had a concordance index with GIST recurrence of 78.9 % . RESULTS	When a simpler score consisting of the 2 strongest predictive factors ( mitotic count and tumor site ) was devised , the groups with the lowest , intermediate high , and the highest risk had 5-year RFS of 76.7 % , 47.5 % , and 8.4 % , respectively . RESULTS	Both scores were strongly associated with RFS in the validation cohort ( P < .001 for each comparison ) . CONCLUSIONS	The scores generated were effective in stratifying the risk of GIST recurrence in patient populations treated with adjuvant imatinib . CONCLUSIONS	Patients with nongastric GIST with a high mitotic count are at a particularly high risk for recurrence ."
"OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of sequential enteral nutrition support in patients with severe cerebral stroke . METHODS	Forty-nine patients with severe cerebral stroke met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into sequential enteral nutrition group ( Group A , n = 24 ) and conventional enteral nutrition group ( Group B , n = 25 ) . METHODS	Patients in Group A received short-peptide-based enteral nutrition support first , then gradually transferred to intact protein enteral nutrition . METHODS	Meanwhile , patients in Group B constantly received intact protein enteral nutrition support . METHODS	The nutritional indexes and the rate of complications were compared between two groups . RESULTS	The nutritional indexes were decreased in both groups within 4 weeks after admission , but the decreasing levels of hemoglobin and albumin in Group A were significantly lower than those in Group B ( P < 0.05 ) , and the incidence of infections and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in Group A was also lower than that in Group B ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	However , there were no significant differences in body weight , BMI , triceps skinfold thickness , biceps circumference , arm muscle circumference between two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Sequential enteral nutritional support can improve the nutritional status and decrease the incidence of complications in critical patients with cerebral stroke ."
"BACKGROUND	Antidepressants are effective in adults with pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders . BACKGROUND	We investigated the effectiveness of citalopram in the treatment of childhood functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) . METHODS	Children with FAP , based on the Rome III criteria ( n = 115 , aged 6-18 years ) , were randomized to receive either citalopram 20 mg/day or placebo for 4 weeks . METHODS	Treatment response was defined as 2 point reduction in the 6-point Faces pain rating scale or ` no pain ' . METHODS	Depression , anxiety , somatization , and physician-rated global severity and improvement were also evaluated . METHODS	Patients were followed up for 8 weeks after medication period . RESULTS	Eighty-six patients completed the medication ( 43 in each group ) . RESULTS	Response rate in the citalopram and placebo groups based on per-protocol ( intention-to-treat ) analysis was 55.8 % ( 40.6 % ) and 39.5 % ( 30.3 % ) at week 4 ( p = 0.097 [ 0.169 ] ) and 72.0 % ( 52.5 % ) and 53.4 % ( 41.0 % ) at week 12 ( p = 0.059 [ 0.148 ] ) , respectively . RESULTS	In per-protocol analysis , more reduction was observed in pain ( F = 3.84 , p = 0.024 ) and global severity scores ( F = 4.12 , p = 0.021 ) in the citalopram group compared with the placebo group over the study period . RESULTS	Such differences were not present in the intention-to-treat analysis . RESULTS	No difference was found between the two groups regarding change in depression , anxiety , or somatization score over the study . CONCLUSIONS	Overall , we found a trend toward the effectiveness of citalopram in the treatment of children with FAP . CONCLUSIONS	Trials with longer treatment duration in larger samples of patients are required in this regard ."
"BACKGROUND	Esophageal cancer is among the most common gastrointestinal cancers for which the main treatment is surgery . BACKGROUND	This study was undertaken to analyze the results of Botox injection in preventing gastric stasis in these patients . METHODS	60 patients with esophageal cancer in the middle and lower third parts were included in our study between 2010 and 2011 , and were randomly divided into two groups . METHODS	In group A , 30 patients underwent pyloroplasty , and in group B , injection of botulinum toxin into the pyloric sphincter muscle was used in 30 patients . RESULTS	The mean age of these patients was 6110.7 years and the male/female ratio was 33:27 . RESULTS	Isotope scans 3 weeks after surgery showed that 5 patients in group A and 3 in group B had delayed gastric emptying ; there was no significant difference between the 2 groups , and the success rate of Botox injection was 90 % . CONCLUSIONS	Considering the fact that there was no significant difference between pyloroplasty and Botox injection on gastric emptying after surgery , and given the need to use less-aggressive techniques and facilitate greater use of endoscopic methods , botulinum toxin injection may be used instead of pyloroplasty as a simple , effective , and complication-free method to prevent delayed gastric emptying ."
"BACKGROUND	Fiber intakes in developed countries are generally below those recommended by relevant authorities . BACKGROUND	Given that many people consume fiber-depleted refined-grain products , adding functional fiber will help to increase fiber intakes . BACKGROUND	The objective of the study was to determine metabolic and sensory effects of adding fiber to bread . METHODS	A double-blind pair of randomized crossover trials with a two-week washout in which two fiber-containing breads were compared with control bread . METHODS	The functional fiber ( fruit fiber and FibreMax ) was added to yield 10 g fiber per serve ( two slices ) . METHODS	Eighty participants ( n = 37 fruit fiber and n = 43 FibreMax ) consumed one serve of bread ( fiber or control ) followed three hours later by a pasta meal consumed ad libitum . METHODS	Outcome measures included glycemia , satiety , palatability , gastrointestinal wellbeing , visual appeal and subsequent energy intake of the pasta meal . METHODS	Multivariate regression was undertaken to test for differences between treatment and control for blood glucose , satiety , and cumulative energy intake . METHODS	Satiety responses were also compared by splitting the data into an immediate response after eating ( 0-30 min ) and a return to hunger analysis ( 30-180 min ) . METHODS	A Wilcoxon sign rank test was used for the first component ( 0-30 min ) and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test for the second component ( 30-180 min ) . METHODS	Between treatment differences for gastrointestinal wellbeing were tested using Pearson 's chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test . RESULTS	Consumption of the fruit fiber bread reduced postprandial glycemia by 35 % ( 95 % CI 13 to 51 ; P = 0.004 ) and cumulative energy intake by 368 kJ ( 95 % CI 163 to 531 ; P = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	There was little influence on satiety and the bread was rated as having poor taste and smell whilst generating feelings of nausea in some participants . RESULTS	FibreMax enriched bread reduced glycemia by 43 % ( 95 % CI 17 to 61 ; P = 0.004 ) without influence on energy intake or satiety . RESULTS	Apart from a lower visual appeal , the FibreMax bread was palatable . RESULTS	Neither bread caused gastrointestinal discomfort related to flatulence or bloating . CONCLUSIONS	Enriching bread with 10 g of functional fiber per serve is feasible although reformulation is needed to create not only an acceptable bread , but a desirable product ."
"BACKGROUND	Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea ( IBS-D ) is particularly debilitating due to urgency and episodic incontinence . BACKGROUND	Some 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 ( 5-HT3 ) receptor antagonists ( 5-HT3RAs ) have proven effective but have serious side effects . BACKGROUND	Ondansetron , also a 5-HT3RA , has been widely used as an antiemetic with an excellent safety record for over two decades . BACKGROUND	Our aim was to assess its effectiveness in IBS-D . METHODS	120 patients meeting Rome III criteria for IBS-D entered a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study of 5weeks of ondansetron 4mg versus placebo with dose titration allowed , up to two tablets three times daily in the first 3weeks . METHODS	Patients completed daily diaries documenting stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form score . METHODS	Gut transit was measured in the last week of each treatment . METHODS	The primary endpoint was average stool consistency in the last 2weeks of treatment . RESULTS	Ondansetron significantly improved stool consistency ( mean difference in stool form between ondansetron and placebo -0.9 , 95 % CI -1.1 to -0.6 , p < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Compared with placebo , patients on ondansetron experienced fewer days with urgency ( p < 0.001 ) , lower urgency scores ( p < 0.001 ) , reduced frequency of defaecation ( p = 0.002 ) and less bloating ( p = 0.002 ) , although pain scores did not change significantly . RESULTS	IBS symptom severity score fell more with ondansetron than placebo ( 839.8 vs 379.7 , p = 0.001 ) . RESULTS	65 % reported adequate relief with ondansetron but not placebo compared with 14 % reporting relief with placebo but not ondansetron , relative risk 4.7 , 95 % CI 2.6 to 8.5 , p < 0.001 . CONCLUSIONS	Ondansetron relieves some of the most intrusive symptoms of IBS-D , namely loose stools , frequency and urgency ."
"OBJECTIVE	Studies have suggested a link between diet and behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) . OBJECTIVE	Parental reports of behavioral changes upon exposure to gluten and/or casein are common in clinical practice . OBJECTIVE	An association between diet type , intestinal permeability ( IP ) ( ` leaky gut ' ) , and behavior has been long proposed but not substantiated . OBJECTIVE	We explored this possible association in this trial . METHODS	This randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study explored the effects of gluten and milk on IP and behavior in children with ASDs over a period of 4 weeks . METHODS	IP assessed by lactulose : mannitol ( L/M ) sugar permeability test and behavior assessed by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Conners Parent Rating were measured . METHODS	Gastrointestinal symptoms in both groups were also monitored . RESULTS	Neither the L/M ratio nor behavioral scores were different between groups exposed to gluten/dairy or placebo . RESULTS	The changes observed were noted to be small and not clinically significant . CONCLUSIONS	Our study although underpowered to show small differences does not support an association between dietary gluten/milk , IP , and behavioral changes in subjects with ASD ."
"BACKGROUND	Probiotics have treatment efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , but the exact mechanism remains obscure . BACKGROUND	One hypothesis is the mediation of melatonin levels , leading to changes in IBS symptoms . OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic , VSL # 3 , on symptoms , psychological and sleep parameters , and pain sensitivity in IBS , and relate these parameters to in vivo melatonin levels . METHODS	Forty-two IBS patients were randomly assigned to receive VSL # 3 or placebo for 6 weeks . METHODS	Subjects completed bowel and psychological questionnaires , underwent rectal sensitivity testing and saliva melatonin assays . RESULTS	Abdominal pain duration and distension intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic group , along with an increase in rectal distension pain thresholds . RESULTS	A correlation between increase in pain tolerance and improvement in abdominal pain scores ( r = 0.51 , p = 0.02 ) was seen with probiotic . RESULTS	There was an increase in salivary morning melatonin levels in males treated with VSL # 3 , which correlated ( r = 0.61 ) with improved satisfaction in bowel habits . RESULTS	When grouped based on baseline diurnal melatonin levels , patients with normal diurnal fluctuations showed an increase in morning melatonin levels with VSL # 3 treatment , which significantly correlated with improved satisfaction in bowel habits ( r = 0.68 ) . RESULTS	They also had reduced symptom severity scores and abdominal pain duration when treated with VSL # 3 , as well as satisfaction with bowel movements and quality-of-life . CONCLUSIONS	VSL # 3 improved symptoms and increased rectal pain thresholds . CONCLUSIONS	Symptom improvement correlated with a rise in morning melatonin , significant in males and subjects with normal circadian rhythm . CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that probiotics may act by influencing melatonin production , hence modulating IBS symptoms , in individuals with a normal circadian rhythm ."
"BACKGROUND	Retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas ( RPS ) are rare tumors that include several well-defined histologic subtypes . BACKGROUND	Although surgery is the mainstay of curative therapy , no universally accepted recommendations concerning the best management have been developed to date . BACKGROUND	Optimization of the initial approach is critical for maximizing patient outcomes . METHODS	An RPS Trans-Atlantic Working Group was established in 2013 . METHODS	The primary aim was to evaluate the current evidence critically and to develop a consensus document on the approach to this difficult disease . METHODS	The outcome applies to primary RPS that is nonvisceral in origin . METHODS	The evaluation included sarcomas of major veins ( inferior vena cava , renal vein , ovarian/testicular vein ) , undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the psoas , and ureteric leiomyosarcoma ( LMS ) . METHODS	It excluded desmoid , lipoma and angiomyolipoma , gastrointestinal stromal tumors , visceral sarcomas such as those arising from the gut or its mesentery , uterine LMS , prostatic sarcoma , paratesticular/spermatic cord sarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma , alveolar/embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma , primitive peripheral neuro-ectodermal tumor , sarcoma arising from teratoma , carcinosarcoma , sarcomatoid carcinoma , clear cell sarcoma , radiation-induced sarcoma , paraganglioma , and malignant pheochromocytoma . RESULTS	Management of RPS was evaluated from diagnosis to follow-up , and a level of evidence was attributed to each statement . RESULTS	This rare and complex malignancy is best managed by an experienced multidisciplinary team in a specialized referral center . RESULTS	The best chance of cure is at the time of primary presentation , and an individualized management plan should be made based on the statements included in this article . CONCLUSIONS	International collaboration is critical for adding to the current knowledge . CONCLUSIONS	A prospective registry will be set up ."
"BACKGROUND	Several probiotic strains have been shown to enhance human resistance to infectious disease . BACKGROUND	It is speculated that these strains may impose this effect by excretion of anti-microbial components , by competing with pathogens for intestinal nutrients and/or mucosal adhesion sites or modulating the immune system . OBJECTIVE	A parallel , double-blind , placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males , to study the effect of a blend of probiotic bacteria ( Lactobacillus helveticus Rosell-52 , Lactobacillus rhamnosus Rosell-11 , Bifidobacterium longum ssp . OBJECTIVE	longum Rosell-175 ) and a probiotic yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii CNCM I-1079 ) on enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) challenge . OBJECTIVE	Primary outcomes studied were fecal ETEC excretion and total fecal output per day . METHODS	Subjects were randomized to the probiotic ( 5 10 ( 9 ) colony-forming units ( CFUs ) ; twice daily ; n = 30 ) or placebo group ( twice daily ; n = 30 ) . METHODS	After 2 weeks , subjects were orally challenged with a live attenuated ETEC ( 3 10 ( 9 ) CFU ) , previously demonstrated to induce mild , short-lived symptoms of a foodborne infection . METHODS	Before and after ETEC challenge , subjects collected 24h fecal samples . METHODS	Compliance to study guidelines , stool consistency ( Bristol Stool Score ) , stool frequency , and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal ( GI ) complaints were recorded by the subjects on a Daily Record Questionnaire . RESULTS	ETEC challenge induced a significant increase in fecal ETEC excretion in both groups . RESULTS	However , a statistically significant increase in fecal output was only observed in the probiotic group . RESULTS	ETEC challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of fecal dry weight , and an increase in reported Bristol Stool Score , stool frequency and GI complaints . RESULTS	Dietary probiotics significantly decreased the percentage of fecal dry weight . RESULTS	In addition , ETEC increased C-reactive protein , total secretory Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) and Immunoglobulin G Colonization Factor Antigen II . CONCLUSIONS	Dietary probiotics did not increase resistance to oral attenuated ETEC challenge in human subjects ."
"OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate the hypouricemic effects of green tea extract ( GTE ) in healthy individuals . METHODS	This study comprised 1-week control , 2-week interventional , and 1-week follow-up periods . METHODS	Participants were assigned randomly at the interventional period to consume GTE at 2 ( GTE2 ) , 4 ( GTE4 ) , or 6 ( GTE6 ) g/d . METHODS	Levels of serum uric acid ( SUA ) , uric acid clearance , and serum antioxidant power ( using trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay ) were measured at both ends of each study period . RESULTS	Of 30 participants , 11 , 11 , and 8 received GTE2 , GTE4 , and GTE6 , respectively . RESULTS	After 2 weeks of consumption , the mean SUA level tended to decrease in all groups , with no statistical significance . RESULTS	Serum uric acid reduction was greatest in GTE2 ( from 4.81 0.81 mg/dL to 4.64 0.92 mg/dL , 3.53 % ) . RESULTS	Uric acid clearance decreased significantly in GTE2 ( from 11.37 6.41 mL/min per 1.73 m to 7.44 2.74 mL/min per 1.73 m , 34.56 % , P < 0.05 ) and GTE4 ( from 8.36 3.41 mL/min per 1.73 m to 5.78 2.33 mL/min per 1.73 m , 30.86 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Serum antioxidant capacity ( TEAC ) increased significantly in GTE6 ( from 32.77 3.39 mg/mL to 35.41 3.17 mg/mL , 8.06 % , P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	There was no significant change in creatinine clearance . RESULTS	Gastrointestinal adverse events were common , but usually mild , with no medical treatment required . CONCLUSIONS	Green tea extract may modestly lower SUA level and decreases uric acid clearance . CONCLUSIONS	Green tea extract also significantly elevated serum antioxidant capacity with a positive dosage effect . CONCLUSIONS	The effect of GTE on SUA in healthy individuals was short term . CONCLUSIONS	The effects of GTE on urate handling in patients with hyperuricemia or gout need to be determined ."
"OBJECTIVE	The optimal second-line regimen for treating advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) remains unclear . OBJECTIVE	While irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) plus cisplatin ( CDDP ) combination therapy and CPT-11 monotherapy have been explored in the second-line setting , the superiority of second-line platinum-based therapies for AGC patients initially treated with S-1 monotherapy has not yet been evaluated ; therefore , we aimed to examine the survival benefit of CPT-11 / CDDP combination over CPT-11 monotherapy . METHODS	AGC patients showing progression after S-1 monotherapy for advanced cancer or recurrence within 6 months after completion of S-1 adjuvant therapy were randomly allocated to CPT-11 / CDDP ( CPT-11 , 60 mg/m ( 2 ) ; CDDP , 30 mg/m ( 2 ) , q2w ) or CPT-11 ( 150 mg/m ( 2 ) , q2w ) . RESULTS	Sixty-eight advanced and 95 recurrent cases were evaluated . RESULTS	The median overall survivals were 13.9 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 10.8-17 .6 ) and 12.7 ( 95 % CI : 10.3-17 .2 ) months for CPT-11 / CDDP and CPT-11 , respectively ( hazard ratio : 0.834 ; 95 % CI : 0.596-1 .167 , P = 0.288 ) . RESULTS	No significant differences were observed in the secondary end-points , including progression-free survival ( 4.6 [ 95 % CI : 3.4-5 .9 ] versus 4.1 [ 95 % CI : 3.3-4 .9 ] months ) and response rate ( 16.9 % [ 95 % CI : 8.8-28 .3 ] versus 15.4 % [ 95 % CI : 7.6-26 .5 ] ) . RESULTS	The incidences of grade 3-4 anaemia ( 16 % versus 4 % ) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels ( 5 % versus 0 % ) were higher for CPT-11 / CDDP than for CPT-11 . RESULTS	Exploratory subgroup analysis revealed that CPT-11 / CDDP was significantly more effective for intestinal-type AGC , compared with CPT-11 ( overall survival : 15.8 versus 14.0 months ; P = 0.019 ) . CONCLUSIONS	No survival benefit was observed upon adding CDDP to CPT-11 after S-1 monotherapy failure ."
"BACKGROUND	Lysine requirements of well-nourished children from developing regions have been found to be similar to those of children from developed regions ( 33.5 mgkgd ) . BACKGROUND	However , intestinal parasites have been shown to increase lysine requirements in undernourished adults , and it is not known if a similar phenomenon occurs in undernourished children from poor and unsanitary environments . OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to measure the lysine requirement of moderately undernourished school-aged Indian children by the indicator amino acid oxidation technique before and after successful treatment for intestinal parasites . METHODS	Twenty-one undernourished school-aged children ( 8 y of age ) with z scores between -2 SD and -3 SD for height-for-age or weight-for-age , who tested positive for intestinal parasites , were studied before and after successful antiparasite treatment . METHODS	Children were fed any 2 of 7 levels of lysine intakes ( 5 , 15 , 25 , 35 , 50 , 65 , and 80 mgkgd ) in random order . METHODS	The lysine requirement was determined by applying a 2-phase linear regression crossover analysis on the fractional oxidation rate of the tracer L - [ 1-C ] phenylalanine in response to the graded lysine intakes . RESULTS	The lysine requirement of undernourished children with intestinal parasite infestations was determined to be 42.8 mgkgd ( 95 % CI : 32.6 , 53.1 mgkgd ) , and after successful antiparasitic treatment it was determined to be 35.5 mgkgd ( 95 % CI : 25.5 , 45.5 mgkgd ) . RESULTS	The results were significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) , although the 95 % CIs overlapped . CONCLUSIONS	The lysine requirement in undernourished children is similar to that of well-nourished children , and intestinal parasitic infestation increased the lysine requirement by 20 % ."
"BACKGROUND	Probiotics are microbial supplements that have shown efficacy in a wide range of applications . BACKGROUND	To assess the safety and effects of enteral probiotics in critically ill neonates . METHODS	A double-blind , randomized controlled trial was conducted in 100 full-term infants with critical illness according to scores of neonatal acute physiology . METHODS	Fifty neonatal intensive care patients were randomly assigned to receive probiotics three times daily after birth for 8 days , and fifty patients were not given probiotics , but who received a placebo . METHODS	The incidence of sepsis , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) , nosocomial pneumonia , and necrotizing enterocolitis were recorded . METHODS	The prognosis of probiotic treatment was determined based on the rate of recovery and hospital days . METHODS	Serum IgA , IgG , and IgM concentrations were measured on days 4 and 8 . RESULTS	Infants in the probiotics group showed a significantly reduced rate of nosocomial pneumonia ( 18 % versus 36 % ) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( 6 % versus 16 % ) compared with the placebo group ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	Significant results were demonstrated in favour of the probiotics for days of hospital stay ( 13 3.5 d versus 15.8 5.3 d ) ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	However , there were no significant differences in the occurrence of sepsis , necrotizing enterocolitis , and recovery rate . RESULTS	Patients given probiotics had significantly greater levels of IgA than those in the placebo group ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS	No serious adverse effects in the study population were noted . CONCLUSIONS	Supplements of probiotics to critically ill neonates could enhance immune activity , decrease occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia and MODS , and reduce days in hospital ."
"BACKGROUND	High levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) are associated with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) progression and high mortality . BACKGROUND	In the Phosphate Reduction Evaluation of FGF23 in Early CKD Treatment ( PREFECT ) study , we assessed the effect of reducing intestinal phosphate absorption using lanthanum carbonate on FGF23 levels in normophosphatemic patients with CKD stage 3 . METHODS	Thirty-five individuals were randomized to lanthanum carbonate 3000 mg/day ( n = 23 ) or placebo ( n = 12 ) for 12 weeks . METHODS	Levels of intact FGF23 ( iFGF23 ) , C-terminal FGF23 , serum and urinary phosphate and calcium , intact parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were assessed . RESULTS	The median age was 65 years in the lanthanum group and 73 years in the placebo group ; 58.8 % and 41.7 % were men , respectively . RESULTS	No significant difference was seen in mean iFGF23 between groups at week 12 . RESULTS	There was , however , a transient reduction from baseline in iFGF23 in the lanthanum group at week 1 , from 70.5 pg/ml to 51.9 pg/ml , which was not seen in the placebo group ; this between-group difference in percentage change from baseline was significant in post hoc analyses ( p = 0.0102 ) . RESULTS	Urinary phosphate decreased after 1 week of lanthanum treatment and remained low at week 12 . CONCLUSIONS	Reducing intestinal phosphate absorption with lanthanum carbonate did not lead to sustained reductions in iFGF23 in patients with CKD stage 3 , although phosphaturia decreased . CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that factors other than phosphate burden may be responsible for driving increases in circulating FGF23 in patients with CKD .
